"I joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than I'm used to. It's a slight PPR league- .2 PPR. Standard besides 1 points for 15 yards receiving, .2 points per completion, 6 points per TD thrown, and some bonuses for rec/rush/pass yardage. My question is, is it wildly clear that QB has the highest potential for points? I put in the rules at a ranking site and noticed that top QBs had 300 points more than the top RB/WR. Would it be dumb not to grab a QB in the first round?"
"In your scenario, a person could just not run the mandatory background check on the buyer and still sell the gun to the felon. There's no way to enforce it. An honest seller is going to not sell the gun to them when they see they're a felon on the background check. A dishonest seller isn't going to run the check in the first place. No one is going to be honest enough to run the check, see they're a felon, and then all of a sudden immediately turn dishonest and say ""nah, you know what, here's your gun anyway."" They wouldn't run the fucking check in the first place, genius. Your bullshit proposal is **NOT ENFORCEABLE**. This is why people without 

&gt;Here's an idea, why not make a background check system where it would be illegal to sell guns to felons? That doesn't convince you? IDGAF.

We already fucking have that. What aren't you understanding about this?! It's just currently not available to private sellers. I'd like to make it available, but there's no point in making it mandatory.

&gt;You're just supporting it to make a gesture towards background check reform in bad faith.

As a gun owner who has harmed no one and has constitutionally protected rights, I actually don't own the anti-gun side a damn thing. It's people like you that convince me to not give an inch at all. I'm wiling to extend NICS to private sellers as voluntary. Take it or leave it, because it isn't going to be made mandatory. Not gonna happen. Period."
"They don't get paid for how much time you spend building your army. They get paid when you gem it. Having a premade layout saves what, 30 seconds? During that time they've made $0 and still have the ability to make $X if you decide to gem it. "
"I dunno, back before the August update in an A+ lobby for Tower Control in Saltspray Rig, I remember the enemy team barraging us with bombs in a suspiciously coordinated fashion.  And my teammates were also tossing bombs left and right.  Non-stop splat/suction/burst bombs.  Bombs, bombs fucking everywhere.  It was terrifying having to dodge one after the other.  It never ended, and some of them even had bomb rush to toss even more goddamn bombs.

I think I still have PTSD of that horrifying event.  That match really felt like a Michael Bay movie."

"Implement some form of tenure for mods and require a majority vote to remove any tenured mod. Only allow mods to trigger a removal vote on mods lower than them in the hierarchy however.

This removes the possibility of a single mod (such as an absentee top mod) swooping in and blowing up the sub but doesn't create opportunities for hijacking. Importantly, it also doesn't require rejiggering the existing mod hierarchies or ongoing admin involvement in dispute resolution."

"&gt;Baltimore County prosecutors will speak to the victim's family before deciding whether to charge Shattuck, reports the station.

Earlier the parents said: 

&gt;""What she did to my son is heinous. The fact that she paraded her pedophilia in front of her own son is even more disturbing,"" the mother said. ""Any adult who rapes a child deserves to be in prison. Please hold her accountable.""

It seems like they probably will ask that they send her to prison. I hope they do. Honestly that judge basically gave the green light to any adult woman to molest little boys free of consequence in the future and that's simply not acceptable.

"I think you might be missing my point. A gun is a tool which allows you to kill very efficiently. Not having those around means there's less chance for people to make dumb decisions which end up in deaths. I'm not concerned with spree killers or other people who plan to kill, I'm concerned with people who wouldn't otherwise put other's lives at risk when they get angry, but there's a gun at hand. The latter is vastly more common than the former."

"Im Dutch and have watched all Netherlands games for the last few years, Nigel de Jong has been solid during the WC and before and I see no reason at all not to include him since we don't have any non attacking midfielders in our team other then Anita (which I don't really rate) and Blind (who we'll probably need as LB). Tete hasn't even been that good in the eredivisie IMO, so why put him ahead of a expierenced player in the Dutch squad like Janmaat is beyond me.  We don't have a real LB in the squad, only Blind and Kongolo (who didn't play well in a weak eredivisie last season) so that's why I would include Pieters.
   I'm not making assumptions here. I agree that our defense hasn't been that good, that's why I don't get why we don't use Nigel de Jong, that's why I wouldn't use young unexpierenced players like Riedewald and Tete. These matches are super important, we won't qualify if we don't win them, so if you want to experiment with other players I would always use more expierenced players and not players who played with each other before instead of new ones like Tete, Riedewald and Anita.

"Don't


Just take them before/after.


I take PreparE before going out and RecoverE on the come down and my rolls have always been pleasant and my comedowns minimal.  Both can be found on [ravesafer.com](http://www.ravesafer.com)


If you really must take some in with you, the PreparE pack only has 3 pills in it (all of the supplements are combined into these 3 pills), so it's far easier to get them into places than having all the supplements separately.

"&gt; Key word there is ""were"". As I nodded to when I said ""Yeah, back in 1960"".

Which is what I referred to. I pointed out the *history* of the use of nullification logic.

&gt;Guess what? This isn't 1960. It's 2015, 

And so what? So people don't have bad idea? A bigot won't use the same logic to refuse to convict? If it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a drug charge"" it is OK to say ""I won't convict on a rape charge"".

[Here's](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/indiana-law-force-cops-overturned-mans-battery-officer-charge/) a case where a man slamming his house's door against an officer's foot was deemed legal because the officer didn't have probable cause to investigate his house.

&gt; But the appeals court reasoned that, “Constable Webb had entered Cupello’s apartment without consent, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, or exigent circumstances. Because Constable Webb resisted Cupello’s subsequent attempts to close the door, Cupello had a reasonable belief that force was necessary to terminate Constable Webb’s unlawful entry into his apartment.”"

"I think *M* is one of the most interesting early sound films. Fritz Lang really made incredible use of sound, especially for a director who had predominantly done silent films at the time. Much of the film is completely silent which adds to the suspense for me and the anxiety that the film creates. There's never really a wasted sound clip, every line of dialogue is extremely important. Even Peter Lorre's whistling is integral to the plot."

At least candidates like Clinton or Bush have the political muscle to get what they say done. "

The big discussion was about Arsenal - and Arsenal don't have that physically imposing midfielder other teams do"
"It's why these ""roles"" that Smite have are really fucking annoying when more unique gods enter the game.

Smite  gods are lumped in the different pools where roughly the same items are bought, with roughly the same playstyle and are put in roughly the same lanes, with few exceptions."

It's all dependent on what kind of effect you want really. In terms of summoning or buffing. I prefer summons since they actually do really decent damage and clear maps very well if you have an acceptable range. Therefore, Murgoth is probably the best summoned soul or magnificent Magnus (which is also a summon). Prefixes usually determine what type of stat they will have. So for example A **clever** ""soul"" will provide the int stat or a **potent** ""soul"" will provide attack damage. Specifically for a xenon you probably want a **flashy** soul since it gives an all stats boost if you can't manage to find/buy a magnificent soul."

"F striker is all about close combat and high damage combos, F nen is about ranged attacks and support, f grappler is holds and crowd control. Out of curiosity, what level did you get your f brawler to, I have actually found mine to be quite a lot of fun most of the way through.

In terms of which of those is the most fun to level, for the average person its probably going to be grappler. Striker does not really become fun until you get lightning dance at level 40, and nen is probably going to be completely boring to you until you get a bunch of cube skills (what this will mean to you is different per player). I personally have enjoyed my f nen all the way through (currently sitting at 82), it helps a lot early on to supplement with sand splash and low kick, converting them to magic damage with the conversion option."
"Thanks to the despicable Judge Stephen Williams for explaining why our system of law is dog shit and our system of checks and balances is horribly broken in this document.

&gt;One judge in Friday’s appellate ruling went so far as to defend the NSA’s right not to reveal whether a plaintiff had actually been spied on or not. “Plaintiffs complain that the government should not be allowed to avoid liability simply by keeping the material classified,” wrote Stephen Williams. “But the government’s silence regarding the scope of bulk collection is a feature of the program, not a bug.”

Which should bring to mind an older, relevant document.

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But **when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**"
"That is a pretty rude answer. He didn't say that he wants doyalst answers only that immediately banning people doesn't really help anyone.

I much prefer watsonian discussions but there are times dolayst information has a place as well. If we had a spoiler tag we could use to put that under it would be the best of both worlds. The information could be presented in the relevant location but those who want a purely watsonian argument don't have to be interrupted with it. Also there is no logical reason to ban meta discussion involving multiple settings. Again that leads to great discussions. Being a mod you can either work with the community or for yourself. Maybe you should consider what you want to do. "
"It's true that vaccines aren't 100%.  No medication or medical procedure is 100% safe.  There is a risk that some people's bodies will ""overreact"", similar to an allergic reaction.  It's extremely rare, but it is a risk.  There is also a slight risk if the vaccine was stored improperly and bacteria infected the vile (this happens more frequently today because anti-vaxx advocates pushed for eliminating preservatives from vaccines because of misinformation about the preservatives on the internet, particularly thimerosal).

&gt; Lastly, doctors are not scientific leaders. They take the position of being told what to do and are, from day one, under the control of the drug manufactures.

It's not just doctors that agree vaccines are safe, it's the entire scientific community, because the scientific evidence is overwhelming and there has never been a scientifically verified reproducible study that has shown there is a significant danger to any vaccine in use today.  Period.

Millions of people take vaccines, and people who take vaccines are no more likely to develop any type of condition than those who don't."

"I am testing the mods atm, will post my impressions here.

1. The armor plates mod seems balanced to me, not overpowered.

2. Azimuth's oxygen generators are 1x1x1, this is almost OP. I'd rather had them 1x1x2. Haven't tested the tank volume and the oxy generator performance yet.

3. I tested this wake bomb and fell in love with it. It's requires completely different approah to bombing, as well as skill and luck. Not OP but fun as hell. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354194728

4. Azimuth batteries are, in my opinion, OP, as well as their ""fusion"" reactors. Totally destroys the balance, irregardless of the resourse cost.

5. The ""armored"" thrusters look much better, provide the same amount of thrust, and the additional ""armor"" is almost non-existent. Can take a couple more gatling bullets, so not OP, but look much better and should make it into vanilla game. **Large ship armored thrusters require to be adjusted to the latest vanilla game rebalance!**

6. RCS thrusters are very good, should be in vanilla game too. Excellent for precise docking maneuvers, useless for anything else.

7. Accumulators and capacitors are great and seem balanced to me! Accumulators work like batteries that can store more energy, but their output is weaker. Could be great for storing solar energy in bases and large ships. Capacitors are the opposite: very low storage, but can provide big current, thus compensating for intermittent overloads. I checked the storage and output values vs battery volume. The 1x1x1 mini battery is fine, but the slim battery is a little underpowered and needs to be adjusted.

8. Afterburner is a very interesting concept, although, the implementation could be better. I'd like to have those in the game, and I even considered making a similar mod myself, but there is already an existing one.

9. The solar batteries mod I suggested includes centered panels as well. I checked the power output vs surface vs the vanilla panels. Big ships panels provide exactly the same power/surface area, and the small ship panels are just slightly less efficient.

"If your energy is effected that severely, your daily calories are probably below your [Basal Metabolic Rate](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/tools/bmr-calculator). 


1. My BMR is 2064 cal/day, and I want to loose about 1.5 lb/week. 
2. I calculated my TDEE as 2477 (1.2 x BMR) since my job is sedentary. 
3. Now I want to lose 1.5 lb/week (1.5 lb/wk * 3500 lb/cal = 5250 cal/wk), but if I cut my diet by 750 (5250/7) cals/day to 1727 cal/day, I'd be below my BMR and very lethargic (like you describe). 
4. Instead I do about 2500 cal/wk of cardio and cut my diet to 2080 cal/day, just above my BMR.
5. My net calories per week is something like: (Food - TDEE) * 7 - Cardio = Deficit (2080-2477)*7-2500 = -5279 (close enough to my goal of 5250)

Hope this all makes sense! Let me know if you'd like another example with your numbers?

"&gt; I'm a pro-lifer and I don't consider myself a social conservative.

Well that's fine and dandy that you don't consider yourself one; you *do* hold a social conservative view on at least one issue.

"The ONDP targeted their messaging at blue-collar non-Toronto Ontario. The OLP successfully painted that as a move to the right, and continually claimed that they had produced the most progressive budget in history.

That's why the ONDP kept their vote and seat totals basically even, while seeing it shift away from Toronto. That's why people like Jonah Schein lost their seats. (Tellingly, it was the MPPs with unimpeachable leftist bona fides who survived, like Cheri DiNovo.)

The subsequent programme of the Liberals in government, however, has been radically neoliberal, stepping up attacks on unions and kicking the pace of privatisations into high gear. Anyone gullible enough to believe the hype about the OLP's supposed outlefting the ONDP has has learned the error oh their ways, and I don't think they're gonna fall for it this time when Trudeau tries it."

"Because a Google search for how to do Aetherial Reduction lead me here only to tell me ""Hey! you should do that thing you're trying to figure out how to do! gl buddy!"" ...Not OP's fault, but in case anyone else ran into this frustration...

Here's how you do it:

1. Find an ephemeral node. I farm furrymints in Twinpools W. Coerthas from 12a - 4a for example, but they're on a timer all over the new areas. [There's probably a guide somewhere.](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ephemeral_Nodes)

2. Switch on the Collector's Glove action before digging/hacking. It's in your actions list.. the hand by the square/pyramid thingy. It's a permanent thing that stays on.

3. Here's where I was getting confused. Click your furrymint or whatever and it will go to a screen with a 30/30 and it won't let you do jack (which was the point I started doing Google searches and found this thing about how awesome the thing I can't do is)

4. Don't do what I did instead do this.

5. Hit the skill Discerning Eye. Why? Still don't know. Just do it.

6. Now you can hit Utmost Caution skill and maybe some other stuff... again I still don't know what's going on, but it works :p

7. After hitting these cool skills you've had for 2 months without a clue as to what they did you can use ""Methodical Appraiser"" --which is the gather this stuff skill. You'll get something collectible woohoo.

8. Repeat that stuff till the node is empty. 

9. Go to your items, and now those collectibles will give you the option to Aetherial Reduce them.

I know nothing about how to get the best stuff, what the actions do, but it's a start, and it's better than yelling at Google for taking you here for an hour. gl."

Mazda revamped nearly their whole lineup in 2012 and put the most efficient all-gas engine in the Mazda 3.  Gets better gas mileage than the Corolla or Civic and has more power as well.

"That's a very well explained post, here you have my upvote, fellow colleague. 

Just to clear some things up, I tried to express in the PS that I don't mean every single one of us nor every single legitimate complaint; in fact I said in the first paragraph that I understand them and of course there are things that could be better. My limited english only allows me to explain myself up to a certain point, but the overall point is we are overreacting as a whole, at average, even though there are legitimate complaints and things that could (and should) be fixed/changed.  

And even though some changes were made towards more expending or more time consuming, I think that overall they are giving us much more than they ""took"" from us. We got lots of covers to collect and we complain we can't get them all. We got new modes and we complain they are too time consuming. We got new heroes and we complain we can get them easy. We got new costumes and we complain they won't be there forever. I think you can see the pattern.

Also, sometimes we can't stop believing we have the right to have it all or win it all; I wouldn't expect the game to allow me to be #1 in Battleworld with a team of 4* by only pairing me with teams like mine, the same way people don't expect to compete in real life only with same-category people instead of the whole spectrum (i.e. entering in a top university with a low SAT grade; if you don't have top grades you don't go to top places, I think it's fair). I'm sure the matchmaking could be fixed, but at some point you should be paired with teams better than yours in order to hit a ""wall"" at your class. Btw with 60 wins I'm in the top 5000 for the reward, close to the end, so it's not THAT time consuming I'd say. And then again, it's not like you'll miss a big reward, it's more like ""voluntary"". 

Thank you for your two cents :) I think that we can meet each other in the middle after all ;)"

Unless you're the second coming of the greatest Magic player ever, after playing for a month you have absolutely no clue why certain cards should be in what slot, what the tricks and interactions between cards are, what interactions exist, when it's optimal to play something, when to hold priority to respond to a trigger.

There's so much to it that you're basically jumping into the deep end, because being the person who actually designs the cube really requires and understanding that's a step beyond just understanding how to draft, it's needing to understand how the entire system works together.

"I used to think *Fahrenheit 451* was about censorship too, but recently I learned that it's actually a warning about how TV will make people forget about the written word, and now that I think about it, that's exactly what happened in the book: people chose to get rid of books in favor of TV walls."
"I know exactly how you feel. I want to be able to be open about it so bad, but I live in Louisiana. Which is pretty much one of the worst places to be open about it considering we don't even have decent medicinal laws. (Oil only and for very few conditions) If I was in a state like Colorado I'd have no problem with it. The fact that you're working for a place that receives federal funding really complicates things I feel. It's admirable and right that you'd feel this way, but it's probably for the best that you keep it on the down low for the next year at least. "
"Those ""23 steps"" are only needed in case of a market outage, which is very rare. In all other cases, finalizing is as easy as it was on Agora. So it's a win-win here, if the market is up everything goes smoothly, if the market is down you can still get your coins (unlike centralized escrow)

Also, it is more like 6 steps of copy-pasting, not 23. You know, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V. That thing we all learned how to do in the third grade. If a vendor is too lazy to learn how to Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V coins to himself, and would rather have his coins under the control of the market who can exit at any time, then that is his decision.

Additionally, it's difficult to arbitrarily lose your coins in this process, as the console will give you a nice little error notice in red if you screw up Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V'ing something. It's not like your coins will go into oblivion.

Btw, timelocking a 2-of-2? ""Vendors can exit scam with escrow""? You sound like a dumbass... Unless you're trolling, which, congratulations, that is some very good bait"
"Ramos is a decent defender behind the plate.

Gio was sucking even with Lobaton.  Anyways, correlation does not equal causation.

Matt has been alright, considering what he's been given.  He's still a below average manager and he for sure fucked up the series in New York last month."
"I'm definitely considering that scenario and that's why I would link my movement skill to blood magic. Also, ew, that heart and soul cluster. I would feel dirty taking hybrid life/mana nodes when using EB. But I guess it can't be helped."
"Personally, I would prefer this to be an inclusive place for anyone that would like to mock, discuss and document the decay of our capitalist societies.

I would also prefer it to be based in post about real events occuring in the world, new and old, that speaks to that theme. I don't think memes themselves should be featured here, unless they manifest in real life on their own. 

But, I'm not intending to be a despot and I want to hear your ideas. As this is a very new sub I think setting the direction we want earliy and in agreeance with the users we have at this point is key. So please share your ideas and any suggestions. 

At the same time, I don't think it should be a super-serious-all-the-time place either. I would like it to be grounded in real events. With the occasional zesty meme. "
"&gt; Comet storm killing 2 2/1s = RR{1} + 2 kickers, so RR[3].

For Comet Storm to kill 2 X/1's, it only needs to be kicked once, for RR[2]. You get one target just for casting the spell normally. In fact, for killing any number of X/1's, Comet Storm will cost the same as Rolling Thunder.  Comet Storm comes out ahead when you want to deal more than one damage to multiple targets."
"With respect, I think you're putting way too much interpretation in the comments from the story.

I mean, we don't need actual force for rape - if you're passed out of otherwise unable to give consent you can't consent.  Yes, we're being fucked in this in the both drunk, or ""she had one drink"" type bullshit, but rape is the absence of consent for sex...easy and simple.

The prosecutor's comment isn't supportive of changing one's mind after the fact - their prosecution hinged on whether or not she went to the party to have sex, she could still choose to not consent when the situation actually presents itself.  I see no argument that she should be able to change her mind after the fact.

And of course the parents of the little snowflake are going to stand up for their little snowflake.  They're not going to come out an issue a statement telling the world their daughter is a stupid bitch for even going, or wanting to fuck before the party.  Its irrelevant to the story, because every parent will act like that if they believe their snowflake was actually raped.

I do think that this guy probably got fucked by the system (shocking, I know) - but realistically, many of your complaints about the story otherwise seem unfounded.  Just my two cents."
"I second FTL. You'll love it. Guaranteed.

I'd also recommend 'No More Room in Hell' - it's a free Source engine title about survivng from zombies. Despite it's mixed rep, I love it. There's no P2W at all, and it's great for a laugh with a few friends. I regularly return to it with a friend, and it's just great banter.

Not sure if it's considered 'mainstream', but I'd highly recommend the original Metro 2033 if you can get your hands on it (Humble Bundle usually give it away free every year or so). Stellar story, gameplay, and a great title to burn through and enjoy. They released 'Metro Redux', which is 2033 remastered and it's sequel Last Light in a bundle pack. I haven't played the Redux version of 2033 other than a quick jam because I bought the bundle for LL Redux, but they've changed it up too much for my liking. Metro Last Light Redux is fine as there's not much in the way of remastering given it was released so close to the Redux-ing."
"Back in the 90s I remember listening to The City Sleeps by MC 900 Foot Jesus, while driving on a windy forested road at night. Definitely have me goosebumps. Maybe a bit cheesy now but I still dig it. 

Also, I wrote it in another comment, the album Maxinquaye by Tricky fits your requirements exactly. From the opening drum. It's eerie dark and beautiful. "
"Who in the Hell did Bobby Jindal think he was by attempting to dictate what ANY President addresses in their speeches?  He needs to know his place in this country.  Governors do NOT dictate to any U.S. President.  

President Obama was correct to ignore Jindal's request given the damage that climate change has inflicted upon Lousianna, particularly New Orleans."
"If you are connected to the repeater you will experience a drop in speed about 50%.  You'll probably also interfere with other networks around you so as well which will also hurt the quality of the connection. But the upside is that you will have a connection in your room.

You can always try buying you own router and see how that works out. I'd recommend something of quality if you are in a super-congested area (which sounds like you are). Buy something like an ASUS RT-AC66U, put your current modem into bridge mode, and connect the router to that. With some high-quality Ethernet cable that is long enough you should be able to move the router to a more favorable position and have a better signal overall."
"I don't have *that* much of an issue with them, other than the fact that they are apparently buff albino handsome Squidwards... I away saw them as abstract elephantine biomechanoids, like how Giger designed them. 


But I do like how they created the xenos, I always though the xenos were artificial in origin."
"That's what I don't understand. You know that all you have to do is stand behind minions to not get grabbed and yet you still just stand in the open and let Blitz pull you under tower and then complain that he's OP.

I know a lot of times people in low elo are making mistakes like that because they don't know what to do, or they don't know how to deal with a certain ability or champion, but when you know what you're supposed to do (which it seems everyone does with Blitz) and then you still don't do it I just don't understand that."
"Fritz 13 is funny when you play it. ''So das ware die schach.''

I use scid vs PC and load houdini 1.5 on it. It's simple, easy to use for when I want to follow a top game to see whats going on when my frail mind can't handle it."
"Personally, I use after effects.  Don't quote me on it, but I was under the impression that flash is a vector-based animation program.  I used AE because it's an animation and compositing program that works with vectors, rasters, and is built to be friendly with 3D programs.  I know nothing about toonboom."
"For gaming, and particularly MS FSX, you want a stronger CPU. Intel is more recommended for what you're doing. Also 8gb of RAM is more than enough for a gaming machine right now.

I swapped some parts out for others that are faster, higher quality and better for the money.

"My interpretation: Gom Jabbar is an ancient non-Latin incantation in HPMORverse which Draco just happened to have researched in old dark tomes, and far predates the writings we're familiar with. 

Frank Herbert somehow picked up on the phrase, either overhearing it in passing or perhaps by having some actual knowledge of the magical world (e.g. magical relative or somesuch)."
"We do need to significantly decrease the amount of lords. Or find a new way of appointing them. I've always favoured the idea that professional bodies could nominate their own representatives (ie: the General Medical Council, the Royal Society, Institution of Engineering and Technology, various charities, even the Conservative and Labour Parties themselves for political lords.) to hold a position in the House. So they're real technocrats with years of experience that are willing to represent both the interests and knowledge of their organisations in a legislative capacity.

Bit of a pipe dream, though."
"A jumper at my DZ landed herself in a coma with brain damage during an out landing.  It was definitely due to an unforced error on her part, and landing out is something you should always be prepared for cause sometimes it *is* the better option, but lets not pretend like there's never anything to it."
"Makes me sick when I see people say Anti Vaxxer's are an example of ""Natural Selection"" and they deserve it. No one deserves to have their kids paralyzed from polio. This website's top comments show that no one cares about trying to get anti vaxxers informed or preventing disease. they just want to be intellectually superior and mock."

"i don't need to re-read your comment where you misunderstand the proposition and suggest that it would be *less* confusing to provide a completely separate keybind that duplicates the function of something that could be handled by one key with a 3rd option. i already read that stupidity and understood how wildly off base you were - that's why i stepped in to call you insane.

your solution is to provide ANOTHER ball cam key... lol. PSYONIX PLS HIRE THIS GUY FOR GREAT CROSS PLATFORM UI/UX."
"From the male side. Dating another INTJ is a very unique proposition. Being with a woman you can respect for her brain and character is something not many men get to experience. There is immediate understanding, ability to work through issues with nearly no effort, and discussions almost always end with the satisfaction of having found a solution.

There are only 3 things to check, from my experience and reading comments here and elsewhere: 

(a) are both people mature enough to enjoy investing in the relationship and dedicating it some time? If not it will fizzle out.
(b) are both people stable (i.e. no personality disorders)? - INTJ life is hard, many of us carry baggage which can be destabilizing; baggage which is transparent until the moment one gets into an intimate situation with another person and there are feelings on the line.
(c) is there limbic system attraction and can it be sustained. This involves both taking care of the looks department (very hard when you are in the middle of a project) and also just having some traits particular to your gender that keep the lower brain layers of the other person ""on board"" with the plan. Possibly in (c) there is a lot of variability, going from people who couldn't care less about anything other than intelligence (mostly INTP-land), to people who want a more complete package (towards ENTJ land). "
"The Seattle Opera has these.  They're at the back of the upper balcony so the view isn't great, but the speakers mean you can at least hear just fine, but no one can hear you.

I know this because if you feel sick they'll let you use them as well, especially since very few people bring kids to the opera in the first place.  That way you can cough or moan and not bother people who paid $600 for their seats or what-have-you."
"&gt; They did it without paywalls and also without excessive tracking and advertisements.
&gt;

&gt; Then Google came in

Youtube did not have advertising (or even revenue) until *after* google bought it. They were a startup quickly burning through cash, and google bought them for the audience and tried to make it sustainable. "
"I'm not sure - I only know that a while back I tried to link to the Express (to point out how terrible it was) and my comment was auto-deleted. Which is probably why this post links to an archived version, rather than the page itself."
"It will likely go on to your final destination.

If you bag arrives in the final destination airport before you,  it will be in baggage claim then put back somewhere.  You'll need to claim it though an office.  "
"H blademaster is generally pretty bad for assa, I'd suggest grabbing normal class trinket/ heroic censer if those are available to you. Now that you have 4set, your uptime on envenom should be extremely high, specially during execute phase, so you'll definetly see a significant increase in dps on certain fights (gorefiend, tyrant, etc.). 
Now, to the logs: On the reaver kill your popped your CDs before bloodlust. Again, I've said this today, this is only a small dps loss for rogues compared to other classes but it is still a dps loss. I do however believe this was due to lust being popped late and not you misplaying, but do keep this in mind. 
About combat, I do suggest using blade master + soul cap on iskar and xhul like i said a couple comments earlier, tho I'd use soul cap + class on advanced trash. I wouldn't play combat on council, specially considering your OS is assa, which is even better than sub for council. Combat is probably the worst spec, it's all ""fluff"" damage since gurtogg is the real prio. Hope it was useful advice, your logs look solid overall. 
"
"That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I don't care about the aim assist but holy crap I like to play on high sensitivity so I can have an advantage on other players but I can't do that when this bull shit sniper scope moves around so damn fast. "
"Dragon Quest VI... It's okay. I've been marathoning the DQ series for the first time, and was really excited to get to VI since it brought back the vocation system. I'm having fun mixing abilities onto characters...but the story so far has been utterly boring and confusing. None of the characters are very interesting either. Coming off of V, this is a big let down. Otherwise, I'm still kinda having fun exploring stuff and I think that's what DQ does best; gives you a semi-open world to explore.

Xenoblade Chronicles (Wii)... I've needed to play it for a long time and I'm finally making my way through it. I really want to give this game a 10/10 because of the spectacle of it all; it can be breathtaking...but I can't. The story is a bit slow right now though I'm positive it'll get better. The characters seem pretty cool. But the gameplay...it feels like there's way too many systems going on. Affinity with NPCs, Affinity (coins?) with party members, Skill links, Party Gauge, Chains, Gem creation, random items scattered all over the ground for idk what reason, getting equipment drops with totally different stats and some being slotted or perma-slotted, weird targeting system, the whole random ""Press B for a morale boost, whatever that does!"" in battle... it feels like it's too much yet none of it totally goes over my head so I'm still enjoying it all. Also Gaur Plains theme is probably the best video game song ever made."
"Either way there's gender disparities, gender issues involved. Predicated on the fact women feel the need to be more attentive since they fear/will be seen as less than they are (even unconsciously) and guys who feel it's not masculine, that it's weak (so, feminine) of them to *have* emotional and mental health problems. "
"I still can't play a single game without the game crashing. I can't even alt-tab after that and have to either restart the pc or use Win + R to use taskkill (completely blind because i just see a black screen). 

Also the input lag is horrible and somehow my settings are always reset when i start the game (when it crashes + when i close it normally). So i also have to set everything to reduce the stupid input lag...

I have no idea how the XB and PC beta are so horrible after the really good PS4 beta...

Specs: I5-4590, R9 390, 8GB RAM, Win 10 Professional"
"As someone who introduced it to my GF, I'd recommend taking it at her pace. Dota2 can be overwhelming, because there's so much to learn. Let her do the tutorials, watch the vids (just youtube it, there's some great ones), watch the International with her, with commentary. They're great to explain, rewind and explain. GL"
"Even stopping to take photos, sightseeing along the way, keeping up a conversation with a friend. I'd be bored as fuck doing it for that long. At my slowest dawdle I walk at 3 miles an hour. Slowing down beyond that I just can't fathom. "
"Well, considering that even a diamond can be broken with a head-on collision with a bullet, the homeworld likely couldn't fight earth's armies head-on.
If the homeworld had tanks or artillery, or something of that sort, pack your bags."
"&gt; bringing it up just comes off as a stab against AJ

Because at this point this is the only thing WWE cares about. They've always been petty when it comes to bad terms with former employees. They would never acknowledge AJ and use her time with the company and her friendship with Paige on a storyline."
"http://imgur.com/QIeXtFD.jpg

Sorry for the crusty pic and dusty pc but anyway thanks for the giveaway/congrats to whoever wins if I don't."
"Entitlement is a bitch huh. Poor people probably feel like they have a right to the contents of my savings account and retirement fund too.

After all it's fucking bullshit that I'm just leaving that money sitting there unspend."
"I don't mind thinking through an at-bat. David Cone does it on YES often, but seemingly every other sentence from Curt's mouth begins with *I*. We know you were a pitcher, Curt.     
He can discuss pitch sequences, locations and the like without constantly reminding us that he used to play the game.

"&gt; Ironically I'm raised eastern and western, so I've grown up with an amount of fan service as you'd expect, but I notice it more and more the past 5-6 years than ever before because its somewhat exploded into popularity.

It seems we have similar backgrounds from that standpoint.

&gt;I think we hit a good middle ground honestly. Its not often on reddit you can discuss something without hurling abuse about

Completely agree. Great talking to you, and good luck on whatever development project you got going. "
"Full casters. I'm a huge fan of glass cannons and the like. As such, I prefer Sorcerers, Wizards, Warlocks, etc. and all their prestige and alternate-type classes. I grew up playing these types of games with my dad, who was either a paladin, big-ass fighter, or barbarian, so he always wanted a ranged fighter to help deal damage, and I always liked magic over physical prowess. 

This being said, I've been looking into Kineticist, so we'll see if I change a bit. "
"My game installed very quickly, that white bar before you even start the game you see in the PS menu. Yes because I figured the online servers are not online yet seeing as the game should not be out yet."
"At the risk of sounding like an asshole, isn't that kind of the point of having a new generation? Support for previous gens has to stop at some point. Can't really advance in the industry if you're still concerned with older technology.

Mortal Kombat 9 is on PS3/360. If you own an older system you have to get used to playing older games."
"That's kind of a weird song to defen. I mean, they literally said they hated generic pop (not that I don't love that song, but it isn't what most people who consider an example of ""the musical decline"")"
"Hmm, this may be a bit risky, but you could buy all the stuff first and then conduct a session with potential members. Then if they like the session and want to join the club, charge a membership fee. I don't know the college club that doesn't have a member fee. Usually like 15 dollars"
"Is there a UserVoice suggestion for it? If not, there should be. If we could get the votes of all the people who come to this sub, it would definitely make an impact. Now, I could create one and link to it here, but I don't want it to come off as some kind of voting scheme or anything."
"I couldn't agree more with your armor suggestions. Btw I am a huge fan of Army of One of the shotgun. So many times I have gotten a kill to juice my grenade recharge just in time for either a post-mortem or at the very least clutch chain damage.

edit: completely skipped over subclass design sections.... good work."

Once realized, we didn't let her have them alone, but N only escalated abuse towards the family, and eventually chaos ensued.  If I had realized when they were babies that N was still N-ing at others, I would not have let her near them.   I wish I had.

We raise ""family"" relationships to almost holiness in this country.  If it is a good family, yes, have relationships with them.  But if what they are going to teach your child is that the child is worthless, or to be selfish pigs like N, or any other nastiness, then RUN AWAY.  "

That's right, those of you playing at home, what if this movie is going to be ground work for a second movie to take us to central America to explore/destroy those temples? We know from Liberation that the Templar are excavating a Mayan temple in Mexico to find POE, so something has to push them in that direction, right? "

Even when he got his PC, I thought PC gaming was too expensive. However, I eventually caved. I found a prebuilt ASUS at Best Buy and picked it up. That was a huge regret.

"**Tired of League and wanna try out Dota 2? You just took the first step for a better gaming experience!**

**Here a short^^Kappa list of things you need to know.**

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Avoid using League of Legends Terminology

* **Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA""** (CS:GO best ""MOBA"")
* Dota 2 is officially an ""ARTS"" 
* ""Hero"" not ""Champion""
* ""Tower"" not ""Turret""
* ""Creep"" not ""Minion""
* ""Barracks"" not ""Inhibitor""
* ""Ancient"" not ""Nexus"" (Wc3 = Tree and Throne)
* ""Roshan"" not ""Baron"" or ""Nashor""
* ""MMR"" not ""Elo"" (No, it's not the same. Elo = name of the ranking system named after it's creator, MMR = meaning of the shown value ""Match Making Rating"".)

Explanation why Dota 2 is not a ""MOBA"":

* DotA was made on Warcraft III which is an RTS game. Since DotA is basically a modified RTS game the genre was specified based on the genre of the original game, thus making it an ARTS. This is the logical name for it with a clear description and meaning behind it.
* The term ARTS was used before ""MOBA"" was even heard of, but wasn't used as much because DotA was the only game of this kind.
* Why ""MOBA"" doesn't even fit as a genre name: *What competitive game isn't multiplayer, online, and takes on some sort of battle? The first three words apply to nearly every single online game that pits players against each other (obviously). The fourth word, arena, doesn't even describe the DotA/LoL/HoN-genre. Using that word implies an all-hostile area that dismisses the territorial control and lane-pushing among its many facets of gameplay.*

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Before learning Dota 2

* Your rank in LoL doesn't matter when playing Dota 2.
* Don't apply your League habits to Dota 2.
* Be open for everything, there is more than one way to play.
* Your Dota 2 level does not matter and does not reflect your skill.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### General Information

* Every hero is available for everyone. (Different game modes might restrict which hero you can pick.)
* You have a courier which can bring items to you.
* Item's can be dropped, stashed, and some of them can be shared to other players.
* Compared to League, Dota 2 has many activatable items, most of them for utility purpose. 
* You lose gold when you die.
* All units have a turn rate. If you want to turn around with your hero you have to turn first before actually moving. It feels weird at first, but it's really easy to get used to.
* Micro - You move other units by selecting the units you want to move and not by Alt-click like in LoL. Meaning you can also deselect your hero unlike in LoL where your Champ is always selected.
* Mana management is very important. Spells costs way more than in LoL, but they have also a bigger impact when used correctly.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Denying Mechanic

* You can deny your own/allied units with an attack command (A-click).
* You can deny creeps (&lt;50% HP) to reduce the exp the enemy gets and obviously denying potential gold.
* You can deny heroes (&lt;25% HP) who have certain damage over time spells/debuffs on them.
* You can deny towers (&lt;10% HP) to reduce the gold the enemy team receives.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Runes

* Runes are special boosters which give you a certain effect depending on which rune you pick up.
* Runes spawn every 2 minutes on 2 locations on the river.
* There is always a Bounty rune and 1 random non-bounty rune. (Except for game start there are 2 Bounty Runes.)
* No non-bounty rune can spawn twice in a row.
* If a rune is not taken on a 2 minute mark, the rune will change.
* Runes can be stored inside of a Bottle and activated at will for up to 2 minutes before they activate automatically.
* After the rune is being from a Bottle, the Bottle will be refilled with 3 charges.

*The Runes:*

* **Bounty** - Gives 50 + (5 * minute) experience and 50 + (2 * minute) unreliable gold.
* **Double Damage** - Increases base attack damage by 100% for 45 seconds.
* **Haste** - Increases movement speed to 522 for 25 seconds and ignores all slow effects. Can be purged.
* **Illusion** - Spawns 2 illusions that last 75 seconds, and deal 35% damage. Melee take 200% damage, ranged take 300% damage.
* **Invisibility** - Grants invisibility after a 2 second fade time. Lasts 45 seconds.
* **Regeneration** - Grants 100 health regeneration and 67 mana regeneration per second for 30 seconds. Effect ends if hero takes damage, or when both health and mana are fully replenished.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Day/Night Cycle

* Game starts at 0:00 as day time, prior to that it's also day time.
* Every 4 minutes the game time changes (first night at 4:00).
* The game time affects the hero/creeps/building vision.
* Heroes have regular 1800 day vision and 800 night vision. There are exceptions.
* There are spells which affect the game time.
* Moon Shard grants you +250 night vision.
* Aghanim's Scepter for Keeper of the Light will give him unobstructed vision at day while Night Stalker gets unobstructed vision at night.


&amp;nbsp;
***
### Tower Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking a friendly hero with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking the tower itself with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit or hero attacking any friendly unit with auto attack
* Closest enemy unit
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Circumstances for target switch:*

* If the targeted enemy unit or hero goes out of range
* If the targeted enemy unit or hero dies
* If an enemy unit or hero targets a friendly hero
* If an enemy hero being attacked by the tower manually attacks another enemy unit or hero (in which case, the tower will select a new target based on the above priority order).

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Creep Aggro

*Target Priority in descending order:*

* Closest enemy lane creeps
* Closest enemy hero
* Closest enemy catapult

*Other behavior:*

* Ordering an attack on an enemy hero will change their aggro onto you.
* Lane creeps can follow you anywhere until they lose sight for a longer time or take aggro by other lane or neutral creeps.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Gameplay

* Dota 2 has no *forced* META like League which tells you to play in a certain way or to go on a certain lane.
* Many heroes can be played in many different ways. Called ""support"" doesn't always has to be a support, same as a ""carry"" can also be played as support. Considering you know what you're doing.

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Common Tips

* If you play a hero with an invisibility spell or buy an item with such an ability, don't stand around waiting for an enemy to get low HP for an easy lasthit/kill. Scout the area, gain information and get kills or assist your team.
* Techies Stasis Trap and Remote Mines give vision! Spread them out! Gain vision! Take part in teamfights!

&amp;nbsp;
***
### MOST IMPORTANT

* **Last but not least: Always, and I mean ALWAYS! buy and carry a TP Scroll!!**

&amp;nbsp;
***
### Useful Advanced Guides

* Making an *autoexec.cfg* with useful settings, commands and scripts. [Check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/xetu/comments/2qivoy/xetus_dota_2_autoexeccfg/)
* Advanced HUD customization for colorblind (and everyone else). [Check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/xetu/comments/389q68/guide_advanced_hud_customization_for_colorblind/)

&amp;nbsp;

*That's basically the main things you need to know. Just talk to people that you need some help, ask them what to do and be open for suggestions and tips.*

*If I forgot something tell me and I'll add it.*"
"Agreed but if we use the term delayed it would mean that most major console releases were delayed since they didn't have enough to meet demand. Using the term limited may also be a helpful marketing term that drives up interest due to the perception of scarcity.

HTC may still produce a lot and may be just be trying to cover their bases in case there are problems in manufacturing. I doubt they have an exact number of what will be available until they are made and pass quality control."
"Honestly, try spicebomb. I've used that for years amongst other colognes (margiela jazz club, tom Ford tobacco vanille, and CDG wonder wood) and have always gotten comments on how good it smells. Good masculine scent but not over bearing."
"It's odd to hear what I (and most of my friends) consider a feminist perspective to be spoken as a counter to a supposedly feminist point.

I fully agree with your perspective, but not your characterisation of feminism.

That's the issue with a lot of tumblr satire subs, you miss a lot of the more rational discourse simply by not seeing it.

Case in point, the first result on google for 'Feminist Sex Ed': http://www.scarleteen.com/article/etc/what_is_feminist_sex_education 

Emphasises consent and negative effects on men as well as women of poor sex ed, and characterises every feminist perspective I've encountered in the real world rather than online.

Sorry for the ramble, I just get rather concerned that the structure of reddit (and the bias of the default subs) lends itself to an unnecessarily adversarial perspective in regards to feminism.

In this scenario though aren't we talking about someone who used to LOVE Sushi and would talk about it and even get dressed up in Sushi-themed garb in order to enjoy it....Who then suddenly became a pro-fish activist?
"You can easily enjoy BF4 without premium (free night map update comes out September 1). Servers are full but there are many game modes that are dead.(the not fun ones) Premium mainly adds cool new maps, a few good guns and neat little features, I got it for $20 and I think it was worth it."
"From your screenshot; they're already installed. As long as they show up in your DATA folder they'll show up in MO.

They say 'unmanaged' on the left panel because they're in DATA rather than the MO directories, but that's normal. "
"&gt;If you found the gun itself at Zeleno (which is pleasantly surprising, actually), then maybe the ammo can spawn there, too.

"Jealous that she was allowed to have long hair, I was teasing my sister with some large scissors; vertically chomping them with my little 8 yr old arms bellowing in time with the snaps of the scissors, "" I'M going to CUT your HAAAAIR!""....She thoughtlessly grabbed for the scissors on ""HAAAAIR!"" and was sliced to the thumb bone on both sides. We, having no idea what to do and convinced we would both be disowned, tried wrapping the wound with toilet paper and applied some pressure( to keep blood coming out like one stops a leak in a dam). When the wound started dripping, I grabbed a handtowel and wailed for our parents. Mom took her to the ER AND I ""sat on the wall"" for hours convinced I was going to die when mom got home. It was a hard evening, but I was spared. I also try to avoid handing her a pair of scissors."
"I would like to interject with the only somewhat relevant comment that many of you guys on the fitness RP kick are obsessed with extreme fitness (ambition is great) and may be overdoing it on the supplements. You also want to consider the impact on your joints because one day you will be older and you still have to live in your body. Building muscle strength gradually but steadily will reduce your risk of injury.

If you do everything in proportion, you'll still be in the top 5% of game guys in a sea of pudgy manboobs, so don't screw up your long term health for short term gain. Let bitches play the short game and drive into the wall.

Every time read an article on protein the recommendation has gone up. Yes muscles are made of protein, but Your body doesn't need this much damn protein !  If your body doesn't use it all it it turns to ammonia in your frigging blood and it's a toxic load on your body before your kidneys take it out.

Creatine , T+ boosting herbals,wunderbar ! etc but are getting overused. I think these are icing on the cake. Again, if you take too much or take and skip your workout your fucking organs are going be stressed cleaning up this toxic soup at the end of the day.

Also I suspect a lot of people mugatu included take this stuff at the beginning of the day based on the workout they intend to do and don't get to half the time.

You want to take just enough to match your goals gain level, exertion level, you need to take breaks. More beyond this level is stressing your body out.

As (anecdotal single data point allegory)proof I offer the example my friend who trained hard for a endurance race type competition and came in first out of 1000 6 months ago. Combined with the paleo diet.

He's been out for the last month and a half passing kidney stones. Maybe this would be an acceptable trade off for greatness that will give him an alpha boost of poon so he can go die like a rutting moose, maybe it was unnecessary but look at *your* calendar realistically and other commitments decide whether your supplementation is going to get you there.

Mugatu says this out of love as he doesn't want to see you guys on dialysis. "
"Her passive gives her speed, percent health dmg and health back. Its very strong.


She also has HUGE chase potential, much like Riven. If you get a lead, its easy to chase people down because you have a dash, your passives move speed and your ult (which makes you faster around the people you ulted and gives you more opportunities to pop your passive). 

Not to mention her ult is ridiculous if you can manager to get it off.

Her W is kickass too, it reminds me yasuo's windwall. She becomes immune to incoming dmg, and if the dmg was a displacement she has potential to stun her opponent. 

Lots of outplay potential, health back and move speed. "
"actually, dkali is very useful on mono color teams, or more accurately, combo teams too. her unbindability + time extend awakenings are amazing. but it is her skill which makes her, in my opinion, the most versatile sub in the game. 6 turn cooldown board wipe which can be chained in conjunction with the likes of persephone or claire for extra damage. the active can be used for utility for a bind clear if given six hearts, or to stall out hits you otherwise would not be able to heal back up from.

lkali is a bit more limited i think."
On top of this there is also a Catholic Byzantine Empire. A unified Nubia going all the way to Egypt that is still Miaphystite. An Empire of Francia. An Empire of Carpathia that is Sunni. A Catholic Andalusia with a 6 year old Irish King. So much happens when you let everything run unchecked.
Because those sort of comments bring nothing of value to the comment section and people obviously does not like like them. The fact that you have multiple accounts (implying that you replied to your own comment?) doesn't change that fact.
"&gt;Please quote where I said ""We need the initiation of force to solve societal problems"".

Trying to weasel out huh? Statism requires the initiation of force. If you say we need taxes and fiat currency, you are saying we need the initiation of force. If you say we need a government monopoly on certain services, you are saying we need an initiation of force. 

Now justify why we need it. Stop being an idiot. "
"Yeah. I was at the watch party with a lot of my friends and I got so pissed off listening to these two ""fans"" in front of me talk shit about the team. They left with 15 minutes left in the third. When we tied it up, that entire crowd lost it. I was so nervous during that third intermission. I was anxiously dancing. When he scored that goal I about started crying. That was one of the most amazing things I have seen in the playoffs. That moment outdoes any other moment for me, hands down."
I think it's because there are more IT guys on reddit than alot of other occupations for say and there are just alot of people who carry across the US (and a few other countries) so you are bound to see more IT guys carrying as more IT guys post.  I am horrible at wording things but I hope that makes sense.
"I haven't seen any journal that accepts anything without a university or other institute adding their stamp on it, not even arXiv. The work is all my independent and original work, which is why I have an issue with people putting their name on it"
"If this is really for physics, just expand it in an infinite series and you have it easy.  The desire for ""expanded in elementary functions"" is not as helpful as it may seem - most of the important ""functional relationships"" you may look for have derivations using the infinite series.

Or even simpler, expand as an infinite exponential series using the standard geometric expansion of reciprocals.

This is a perfect example of a simple to integrate function that becomes much harder when you are focused on elementary expansions and the standard substitution and by-parts tricks of calculus.  Part of learning physics is learning to ignore all that unnecessary complication and just brute force the solution to make progress."

"Wish it were true-but there is also the category of those that are blatantly racist yet deny it, using the excuse ""Im not racist cos Im Liberal"". I've come across a disturbing number of feminists who claim to be Left wing who also are racist.

Political labels are used like fashion nowadays. But they rarely reflect the person who hides behind them anymore. "

"I don't think cultural libertarians are making any claims as to what a person can do with his property. Instead cultural libertarians are making a statement about the value of freedom of expression in culture and media. While the political libertarian defends the right of a road owner to refuse a political parade, the libertarian with a general support for human freedom, may still take the cultural libertarian perspective that it's good in general to let other people have their say.

Instead, all this did was make our gaming sessions frustrating and a source of tension. She did end up getting pretty good, but it's a miracle that she kept playing.

This also depends her personality: someone who plays games to achieve mastery and compete will respond better to coaching than someone who just wants to relax and goof around.

"which hype? That she would return in the show? I really really hoped she'd return at the end of the season before last - I thought it would have been a great way to keep the King in the North plot more relevant. The show went a totally different way in the end, and honestly I thought from that point onwards it was on a downward trend. The last season had very few 'great moments', regardless of whether it was coming from the books or D&amp;D. For me the finale this year felt so cheap; it was an old fashioned 'create as many cliff hangers as possible' ending. A glorious post from a few months back said that the show was becoming a parody of the books, and in that episode it definitely felt true. 

Sorry if that was too much of a downer - I'm still looking forward to the next season! The show can recover. "
"In the situation you describe you might get a few extra ones at most. Say you have 3 carpenters and have requested 10 barrels, you might end up with 12 barrels if all 3 were crafting the 10th one.

They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""fedora family"" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself.

The problem with that is that it's more analogous to having interrupts add a 3-6 second cooldown to every single weapon skill instead of 10 seconds to one.  There's not really an easy equivalent punishment for thieves since they depend so heavily on their initiative to survive.

"Speaking of the CDC, they also did research into gun violence and found the same conclusions.  Then, the NRA lobbyists convinced politicians through donations to get further research into gun violence completely banned.

That's pretty telling when a pro-gun group spends money to promote ignorance about gun statistics.

I'm actually quite happy with many of the smoking laws and ordinances that have been passed in the USA.  That's good progress.  I'm also happy the FDA just recently told Cigarette company to stop using labels like ""natural"" on the box.  I'm all for improving public health, and at least in the tobacco realm there has been good progress.  Back in Wisconsin, when I lived there years ago, I actually spent considerable time promoting and supporting causes that led to bans on smoking in places like restaurants, bars, and bowling alleys.  I suppose my family being involved in public health, social work, education, probably helped form me into someone who fights against things that harm people.  Not everyone shares my background.

I guess I'd wonder why someone would be opposed to reducing deaths.  I mean, even if there were stronger restrictions, but not an outright ban, would that not help?  Yet pro-gun people and groups are often vehemently opposed to more stringent background checks, mental health checks, and sales tracking.

If you paid attention, I support statistics, facts, and history of successes for being supportive of a government program designed to protect people.  This should have been a major clue that I do not, in fact, support unlimited government data collection, spying on citizens, and the patriot act.  I think the violations to people's freedoms and privacy are unconscionable in this case.

So while I do not support doing things ""by any means necessary"" but in fact support a fact based, prudent approach, I will continue to hold my stance that fewer Americans should be gun owners in an effort to reduce death from gunfire."

"My parents were die hard Michigan fans, so my first memories of Michigan football were from when I was about 7 years old in the late 80s. And for the longest time I didn't even realize Ohio St. was a significant rival. It sure seemed to me like the season opening game against Notre Dame was easily the biggest game of the year, an annual match up of two top-5 teams. The next biggest game was the Michigan St. game, because there were a decent chunk of my classmates who rooted for them. I didn't realize Ohio St. was any different than all the other Big Ten teams we beat every year on the way to the Rose Bowl until like 1993, when they were undefeated and highly ranked (and we still beat them). 

So, warning to Ohio St. fans: things can change."
"Yes! Well said :D

In addition to this, I feel the village aspect is largely unrecognized/not encouraged in the US society. I'm African-American and was ""raised in the church."" Beyond the 'brothers' and 'sisters' of my home church community (who were effectively mentors and surrogate family members), I was very close to my *actual* cousins, aunties, uncles, and grandparents. Family friends, which included neighbors, parents' co-workers, and my sister and I's close friends' families, also played a heavy and substantial role in my upbringing. Nevermind the teachers, teacher's aides, and other adult leaders of the many extracurricular activities I was involved in over the years. I don't understand how our (US) culture can encourage so many independent thoughts and beliefs to the exclusion of many potentially helpful voices when it comes to raising a *child*!

"Staying home is an individual decision. 

Staying with the person is your decision. 

It takes both of these things to have lived together as a one-income household.  If you don't want to be a one income household, leave. If you stay, you enabled and allowed the lifestyle to happen. 

The other person gets alimony if the lifestyle of a one income house hold was previously had. If you left, then there wasn't a one-income lifestyle, because a lifestyle requires living together.

"&gt;  Israel's hand ~~was always sent out for peace~~ they would like to not have every Arab nation trying to kill them an example being the 1948 war where the Arab league attacked and lost.

"&gt;Personally I'm all for her aborting the pregnancy but she shouldn't be able to abort the child in order to avoid it being tested to establish the her rape victim is the father though.

That is a kind of weird argument, isn't it? First off, I am quite sure a paternity test can be performed on an aborted fetus (sorry, that is a disgusting thing to write). Secondly, imagine being a child who was born in order to prove whether your mother raped your father — being a piece of evidence in a criminal case, so to speak. Can you imagine how such child must feel? It is shockingly unethical.

As for in general whether to take children away from rapist parents; I guess it must come down to individual cases. They would not necessarily be bad parents in *all* cases. The only argument that applies in *every* case would be  that parental cooperation would force the rape victim into persistent contact with their rapist, which we can't have, obviously."
"My assumption would be that as long as the dev community embraces Touch (i.e. allows their controls to be re-mapped for Touch) Oculus will simply replace their Rift + Xbone controller bundle with a Rift + Touch bundle, albeit at perhaps a higher price.  They'll possibly also have standalone Rifts at that point.

Came here to say that.  Glad to meet another fan.  Thinking about scheduling a trip to the UK to visit family in March as they will be there on tour and I could catch them in either Nottingham or Norwich.
"Make sure to bake keyframed moving elements in C4D. sometimes, interpolation between keyframes can be slightly different in C4D than Ae, making it out of sync. Also make sure framerates are correct. Do you use .AEC files?"
"I don't think intuition is categorically better than sensing. Sometimes you need a concrete focus on reality in life. I find sensors tend to be better than intuitives at doing careful and precise work, especially xSTx types. It's the xSFx types that, in my personal subjective opinion, are totally worthless human beings. Their biggest strength seems to be socially conforming obedience - strength through cohesive numbers.   "
"Well, I'm inclined to say: *why not both?* ;-)

I know what you're getting at, but provided you recognise experiences for what they are (peak and mundane it's all the same), then you are fully free to enjoy them, since you realise you *aren't* them fundamentally. That even includes having fun by being a bit of a dick in an argument now and again.

Perhaps it's not what you mean, but surely pursuits of power are only ""distractions"" if you think you are separate from the world and that one part will overcome the other? In exactly the same way as ""seeking"" is a distraction. So long as you don't mix up the narrative with some sort of ""development"" - you have understood that although you may change, you never progress - it's okay I reckon."

"Cause it is. Warcraft lore has always been hammy, but it hasn't been as outright lazy as it was in this expansion. It's really exemplified by Grom's sudden turn to heroic character at Hellfire Citadel, when the entire rest of the expansion he was The Threat that we were trying to kill. Like, I don't know how much you follow Game of Thrones, but if Ramsay Bolton decides to help out against the White Walkers you can sure as shit bet that Jon Snow isn't going to just pat him on the back when it's over. And yet how many atrocities did Grom's armies commit against the Draenei with zero provocation? And now everyone's cool? "
"They have pretty good vision actually. In water too with transparent eyelids. They even have great night vision with a layer behind their retinas called tapetum. There was a study in the 60s I read recently which indicated they may be severely farsighted while underwater, compensating with other senses to hunt prey. In open air their eyesight is just fine though as well as having super senses such as detecting pressure waves, temperature variations and chemical stimuli using dome pressure receptors which cover their entire body. In other words they are usually very aware animals of exactly what is going on. The reason I think these are blind is that they weren't able to see where the fish landed at all, they do use visual cues. Usually you can throw a piece of meat at them and they'll snatch it out of the air. "

You would deserve to have your child taken away from you if you let him live in such filth. Sorry but this guy is putrid. It's already animal abuse for your cats to be stuck with your trash husband and the literal dumpster he lives in.

Your statements about your husband being dealt a harsh lot in life and needing a gentle touch are just blah blah blah excuses. They are symptoms, not the problem, and you are contributing by enabling his garbage behavior.

This guy needs to fester in his own filth until he hits rock bottom enough, on his own, he has to better himself. As long as you clean his house and he just doesn't care if it's not clean, nothing will get better and your kid will have no respect for his slob dad. He'll probably never want to invite his friends over so they never see Jabba the Hutt slime trailing his way around the place and make fun of him.

A heart attack at 26? This guy is already dragging you down with him and will rot your life. Separate and tell him if he doesn't better himself and his living conditions, you will divorce in 6 months, 1 year, whatever.

I'm 21 now and since I lost my virginity at the age of 15, sex for the 'lulz and jizzing' is all I've really seen sex for. Upon listening to this show I've really had to think about my reproductive capacity in a new manner. I used believe the whole ""yea it's a biological reaction no different than a turd"" thing back in my 'edgy' teens (thank you extremely liberal upbringing). But even then I've always wanted to get a vasectomy and adopt a child instead which is causing me some internal conflict. I just can't justify creating a new child, not saying anyone is wrong for wanting to go forth with creating their own child as a couple, but I feel that if I can help an unwanted child I'd rather do that. The vasectomy would be to make sure that no pregnancies occur by mistake, but gives that me 'cum obsessed individual that's wasting their reproductive capacity' feel. The fact that I only want to adopt though reminds me that, technically, it'll be wasted anyways. 

Would really enjoy to hear your thoughts on this, and thanks a ton for doin whatcha do."

I haven't noticed a lot of improvement in my hip flexors, but that might also be because of a lack of core strength, or simply because I'm not consistent enough in doing the exercises."
"I understand that, but that being the case, there is no need to follow him, or imitate the Apostles as they imitated Christ.

"They need to go after Fortaleza quickly, and hopefully cut Brazil off from further northern expansion.

"A result of the virulent rivalry between Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire over the control of Syrian territory surrounding Rafah, this conflict saw Ptolemy IV Philopator, the then Pharaoh of Egypt, battling against Antiochus III the Great. The North African Forest elephants used by Ptolemy IV charged towards their larger Asian cousins at the beginning of the fight but fell back not long after due to panic, causing a bit of disruption and confusion amongst the Egyptian infantrymen. In spite of this setback, the Egyptian phalanxes were able to drive back those of the Seleucids, while some of their cavalrymen pursued Antiochus, distracting him and thus preventing him from gathering his now retreating forces. This would lead to a Ptolemaic victory over the Seleucid Empire and temporary Egyptian control of the region, as well as the capture of the majority of Antiochus' Indian war elephants.

All else aside, this particular part of the Syrian Wars is especially notable for being the only known battle in history in which African war elephants have fought against their Asian counterparts."

As long as Overwatch nails a relatively simplistic class based shooter with a great competitive scene and really inventive and unrestrictive heroes, they can add neat twists later. "

"The basics? If you're an outsider, you're *not* welcome. You can spend 30 years in Denmark, speak fluent Danish and give no immediate tells that you're not Danish. When they find out, they *will* treat you differently. Well, the majority will. You'll still find open minded people who have no issues with foreigners. 

Also, they are far from the most social, friendly or service minded people you'll ever come across. I've been to Canada many times. Maybe only have a dozen or so, but I've collectively spent months of my time there. I've gotten to know a few Canadians through my trips. Life in Scandinavia is very, very far removed from life in Canada. 

I suggest finding a friend here where you can come and live with them for a short period of time and get to know the place before you decide to make a permanent move. These places can look great when you come for a week or two, but the more you learn about it, the less attractive it might seem.

Everyone is different and my experience of Denmark bares no relation on what your experience of moving to Sweden would be like, but you don't have to look far, even on here, to find Swedes who are as anti-foreigner as the Danes are. Most of the foreigners I've come across in all my years here tell a similar tale of unhappiness. The ones I know who came for work or women stay here, but I know countless people who came for work or study who just leave for somewhere better. Hell, I wouldn't be short of presenting a Dane or two who no longer wants to live here. It's not all rosy. There's *far* worse places that you could be that Canada. I've been in Scandinavia for 8 years and I'd still move to Canada tomorrow if the option presented itself."

"1. Cauldron works in mysterious and dickish ways. They honestly believe in forcing other people to make terrible sacrifices for the sake of their half-precognitive half-random-BS plans. So it's totally in character for them to let a murderer run wild if they think it's part of some path or other.

2. Cauldron is busy. Contessa doesn't have much free time.

3. Cauldron is very secretive. Acting too blatantly would compromise their plans, and maybe even force them to face consequences for all of the terrible stuff they've done.

4. Cauldron isn't invincible. Fanon builds Contessa up to be unstoppable, but she has weaknesses and blind spots. Cauldron's actual onscreen win/loss record isn't great. If Contessa went face-to-face with some parahumans, notably Jack, she might die.

Put it all together and you have a good explanation for Cauldron not targeting people like Mannequin. Chances are they do take out a fair number of murderous capes off-screen, but they've got a lot of reasons not to take out every cape that murders pointlessly."

She knows about it, I got the go ahead first. I was shocked it was happening and she's all, ""Thumbs Up!"" Our relationship is... interesting. 

For me personally, my attraction towards women has diminished. A fair bit of my previous attraction was a sort of visual arousal, but always with this strong undercurrent of, ""wish that was me!"" I'm not terribly shocked that's much lower and now men in the abstract generate more arousal for me than women in the abstract. There are things about guys that now turn me on much, much, more than they ever did. I've never actually been in a straight relationship with a man though."

"Snakes have two phalluses that are completely internal. They are actually totally inverted (inside out) when inside his vent (the cloacal hole that ejects waste in both sexes, and eggs in females), housed inside his body just before his tail starts. When they mate, the male will line his vent up with the female's and evert (turn right side out, so it sticks out of the vent and becomes engorged) one penis, which he then inserts into the female's vent, and transfers his sperm to her. Once he's done, his penis inverts again, inside his vent.

As for birds, their genitals are also internal, but I own snakes, not chickens, so am not up to date on their situation.

Incidentally, some snakes don't lay eggs, and have live births, instead."

"they should really go back to flag neutralization.     

i can see their point,  without flag neutralization,  if you want any chance of winning,  you have to go cap the flag.

with flag neutralization, there was a tendency for some players to leave the uncapped flag neutral and go on killing sprees.

this helps avoid that,  but at the same time, makes it harder to cap and get come from behind victories.

they should either increase the time to cap a flag to compensate for lack of neutralization,  i.e. when it fills up half way the speed of the cap doubles or triples,   or bring back neutralization.

i would prefer the time to be sped up drastically when the meters fills up half way, to make the games more enjoyable and increase the action.

"I was joking, but the last time they dropped out of the CL into the EL (or Uefa Cup as it was) that I remember (15 years or so ago) they went all the way to the final.

I seem to remember last year Wenger saying something along the lines of ""going out 3rd in your group is better than the last 16 as it allows you to continue to compete for a european trophy"" - which may have been him moaning about the situation, but also implies that he takes the EL seriously.

Any of the top 4 PL teams have the strength and depth to win the EL (not saying it's easy, but I definitely think all of our teams are capable of doing it), and doing so will boost the coefficient by a lot. 

"

You're competing with 3rd worlders who live worse then you and they do a better job and you're upset.

"&gt;What's worse is the housing crisis here is dreadful, Nobody can afford to rent, let alone buy. London is becoming the new monaco, and all the poor people are being pushed out into the home counties. We have no rent controls unlike NYC. Soon enough the infrastructure will completely break down as the cleaners, security guards, starbucks barristers and fast food workers just cannot afford to live here.  
  
This is the convenient fact that people arguing against rent control never want to address.  Where will the service workers live if you just let the market dictate rent with no controls?  My guess is the reason they all simply say something like ""they can live in the suburbs and commute"" is because no economist has to live on $15/hr.  Start paying economists low wages and watch those studies suddenly start championing rent controls.

I am not anxious about talking to people or showing off what I can do BUT whenever I play in front of others I feel my fingers being a bit more shaky and ""slow"". Usually doesn't happen with singing but I don't get a chance to show that off.

"I agree that mom is just using any excuse to control. But a  few friends of mine and myself have experienced headaches from being too close to a wifi antenna, whether it be on a router or a cell phone.

This is one of the reasons I use a wired headset."
"My boyfriend usually isn't emotionally open, but sometimes he does open up about things that bother or hurt him. I've always took it as a sign of closeness when he does open up.

"Actually, the more I think about it, I'm leaning towards an Impossible Girl 2: Electric Boogaloo scenario happening with Danny. 

His conscience was contained within a Matrix Slice (that's what the Nethersphere was) and we know that Gallifrey has survived in a supposedly inaccessible pocket dimension. What if the Nethersphere wasn't shutting down when he sent that final message - what if it was transmitting its stored data to the main Matrix on Gallifrey (or to the closest proxy - the TARDIS data core)? Missy would have been actively preventing this while working on it, since we see several scenes where she's plugged herself in to greet new arrivals personally. But after she was thwarted, nothing would have kept the slice from going through a regular maintenance cycle and attempting to upload the 'data'. After that point, Danny's a ghost in the machine, quite literally. The question then becomes, how does he get out?

We already know Danny has at least one descendent who looks just like him, and possibly more (it's unclear whether Kai Blue is a descendent of Danny Pink, but it's heavily implied, and we don't get a good look at him before he dies but he also superficially resembles Danny). If Danny was uploaded into Gallifrey's Matrix, it might be possible it has a similar effect on the time stream as when Clara threw herself into the Doctor's timeline.

Of course, I could just be heavily overthinking this whole thing, and the whole scenario is as simple as, ""The writers screwed up."""
"I think one factor people forget is that people are going to keep banning certain things until they get a feel on how to play against it. It's not so much it's op, it's that people haven't assembled strategies to counter it yet so it's hard to play against it.

That isn't always the case but it can make things look stronger than they really are. I do actually think Skarner/Garen do not fall under this case, but the rest do.

"I don't think that minimum wage is enough to support a family of four, nor do I think it was meant for that. Minimum wage is meant for getting on your feet. Then you move up from there. Raising the minimum wage is only going to hurt the people at and near the bottom because the prices for everything from the milk and bread you buy at the store to tvs at Best Buy all have the cost of labor built in. If you raise the minimum wage, you're just raising the poverty line with it. The benefits of having more money are relegated by higher commodity prices. "

"Yeah, caster Jinx is about doing absurd damage with W + R (GB, LW, ER, Lucidity, Muramana). :)

I think the main issue is going to be your build path. Standard build can spike in DPS after one item (IE), while this build takes 2-3 items to really get going. I could possibly see this working in a super passive game where there's a ton of farming involved, but if you're behind, this build is going to take too long to ramp up, and if you're ahead, you're missing out on an early power spike to solidify that lead.

I do love this idea though. The BotRK + Runaan's synergy is always nice when the enemy has a team that likes to clump, especially with the splash on Fishbones. 

However, from your math, it looks like you need to have three targets to outpace a standard build in raw DPS. Raw DPS isn't the be-all-end-all, though, since you want to be prioritizing your damage. Killing one enemy champion faster is preferable to dealing more damage to two, I think, since a dead champion can't output DPS or CC: we need to look at the opportunity cost and relative team DPS. When you eliminate a source of DPS or CC, your team gains an advantage. This is why assassins can be incredibly valuable to a team: a dead champion doesn't contribute to their team. So while your DPS on three targets may be higher, the enemy team's DPS is relatively higher since your damage is spread out and enemies can live a bit longer.

That being said, a team that thrives on sustained fights would love an AoE Jinx I think. A Karma for team shields, an Orianna to pull people into Jinx's Runaan's range, a couple strong tanky initiators (Wu, Zac, Sej, Amumu, etc.), and you've got a nice looking team that doesn't have to worry too much about protecting Jinx since she's at max rocket range.

With the way League has been going with its patches, we may start to see Marksman become more of a supporting DPS role that facilitates other roles to shine (perhaps the rise of Runaan's Ashe to aid juggernauts!)."

"I'll second this. Follow the link in /u/TheFallenPhoenix's post for some really solid information regarding your BOFF ability layouts. 

As a primary Eclipse pilot myself I would endorse flying a Beam Array setup. It's easier to keep enemies on your side than in front of the Eclipse and should give you a boost to your overall average dps; though it is all in your preferred play style and preference.

I'm not sure how your faction reputations look but as already said, replacing most of your consoles with fleet/rep consoles is a solid step towards higher dps. 

Browsing some of the builds on this subreddit can also give you a good idea of where to gear towards."

"Most likely, Boots. Clean, sturdy, boots. High heels accentuate femininity, sturdy boots accentuate the masculinity. Mainly because they impress an aura of power.

"""The term ""adverse possession,” sometimes referred to as ""squatter's rights,"" refers to a situation where title to real property is acquired without compensation by virtue of open and continuous use of the property in a manner conflicting with the true owner's rights for a specified length of time.  In the example above, though you didn’t pay anything extra for the partial lot, your use of the property conflicted with your neighbor’s use of the property for several years.  You adversely possessed his property"""
"I would try to get as reliable a RB as you can in the first round, because they are going to be more valuable, and later RBs have too many question marks to rely on.

I mean, I got my wisdom teeth pulled out about a week ago. All we use in my country is local anesthesia, my jaw was numb for couple of hours but I was good to drive home straigth from the dentist by myself. Didn't even have much pain afterwards and only took one painkiller at the evening.

Was this some bigger operation or what?

"Follow up question. Why did God have to send his son to die to forgive our sins in the first place? Why not just forgive all sins and be done with it?

Also from what I know about God and satan, god seems to be much more evil than satan. God killed nearly everyone on earth in the flood and sends angels to kill people, while satan pretty much only chose to worship himself which really doesn't sound bad in any context. Do you think that satan might actually be god and god (satan) has tricked us into following his word so that he would have more followers?"
"If you want to put in extra work, there are a bunch of things with rebates. You just have to send them in after you buy it. For example, if patience is a virtue, I got 16GB of DDR3 RAM for $20. There were sold separately with mcafee antivirus. You have to install mcaffee on a computer and send in confirmation code with the rebate. So I bought two, one for me and in my fiancé's name and shipped to two different addresses. Got them and created a system restore point, then installed the mcaffee to get the code. I had to sign up for mcaffee auto renew and give a credit card, so I bought two prepaid cards and used those. I got and then Submitted the code into their rebate system and once I got confirmation, I restored to the previous point so that shitty software wasn't on my computer. Did that with another old computer I had and got two rebates, $70 each. This my RAM was $20. 

My fiancé doesn't think it was worth all that effort. "
"The Giftcard/Serve process is a pain but spending to get the point bonus is like free money. Usually you can get $2-400 of value/statement credits per credit card.

"This scenario did not make me change my mind about humans instantly as you're implying, nor do I judge the actions of one person to represent everyone. I was rather implying it is becoming more evident in our society and that bothers me as a Canadian. You're right, humans can act like pieces of garbage, and you could surely agree it is only getting worse... I've seen the good sides of humanity too, as I work in Health Care. My point is, why can't we strive for it to always be getting better and try to fix what is broken.

I think it's moronic to say ""deal with it"". It's that type of lazy attitude that allows this type of behaviour to be pushed further in the direction of ""normal"" in our society, rather than saying let's do something about it. Imagine if you were the victim of someone yelling for you to go back to your country and that he was going to murder your children. Maybe in the future you won't be so quick to attack but rather ask for clarity."
"I was in a single car accident and was almost pronounced dead.  My dad and I were moving to another state answer had been driving almost 14 hours when I fell asleep and drove straight into a stoplight pole at 55mph.  A nurse was driving behind me on her way to work.  She told me later that she was the first to reach me and I didn't have a pulse for at least 5 minutes.  She said my dad came running back to my car and she told him I was dead.  She said he started yelling my name and I suddenly woke up.

TL;DR I wrecked a car, didn't have a pulse for over 5 minutes, my dad yelled my name, I woke up."
"Use a pair of clippers to get it close, then I use a generic Gillette knockoff razor from Sam's. I shave my head in the shower, start by washing with normal body wash or bar soap, which i prefer. After it's clean, get some cream and lather that shit. Now, grab the razor, and starting from the middle of  your forehead, start shaving over your head. Just go straight back, up and over. To give you a midline. Pick a side you want to shave first, and start moving the razor closer to that side when you start your next pass. I use my off hand to align the razor with the midline of my last pass. Do this for both sides. 

For the back of your head and neck, i like to go up along my spine and then to the sides, same procedure as for the top, align the razor, and take each half at a time. Be careful around the ears, i usually add more cream, and shave toward the ear, cut myself too many times trying to start at the ear and go away. Check the ears when you're done and out of the shower. Its easy to miss some hair by the junction with the side burns.

Once you think you are done, wash off the cream and wash your head again with some kind of mild soap. Bar soap works well here... I use dial. If you use aftershave, go for it. I'm a cheap grad student, and i just put some 70%isopropyl alcohol on my palms, and slick my skull with that. Don't cry, let it evaporate, and then put some moisturizer on your nice and smooth head.

Final step, feel badass."

"It's a way to make things difficult, but a terrible way, to say the least.

There are challenging things you can do better and better with practice, like GWD solo Woox style prayer flicking, Zulrah by memorizing the rotations and the correct times to eat etc. and even at smoke devil boss you can practice walking in the correct way to not miss ticks and to get hit as few times as possible.

My problem is in how my eyes see colors differently as a result of repeated retina surgeries, and I can't overcome this with practice. I'm currently doing Cerberus with an eye patch over my left eye. It somewhat fixes the problem for me, but for actually colorblind people or just others with issues similar to mine this kind of thing is just not good gameplay.

Besides, I bet some non-Jagex client could just add overlay melee, range and mage icons on the ghosts, completely negating any ""difficulty"" gained with this type of design."

Nothing that isn't coming to all systems anyways."
"Mida will still have its uses IMO. The movement perk alone almost outweighs the damage shortcomings it might have going into y2.

I also don't doubt that there will be other armor or weapons that will have speed perks on them at some point. We've now got burn resist armors coming our way, so anything is possible. Bungie also loves reusing stuff. I've noticed hammer forged has returned as a perk with tTK, something that was removed with HoW. "

Jenner Benner told me. Cultural backwater: It's not New York City Brisbane? Yes Brisbane. Cultural backwater now with brackenwater? Yes Brackenwater. Over a 6-7 year period, 45,000 millionaire chinekes from China were allowed to immigrate to Canada (100% ended up in Vancouver). A city with a 610,000 person population, overrun by psychopathic millionaire chinekes. The idea was that these arriving Asians would provide jobs and prop up the economy with their wealth. Nah. They use Vancouver to launder money. The city sees none of the cash outside of the initial home buy. Guess who pays higher taxes in Vancouver: The Chineke with 12.3 million in the bank, or the Canadian living outside the city? It's the Canadian who can't afford to life in chinekes central (Vancouver). Hint: The Chineke millionaires pay less taxes than refugees.

BUT SYDNEY? YES LIKE SYDNEY. BC is a chineKe owned money laundering operation. In 30 years when you will only find chinekes faces who can't speak English in the city of Vancouver, I will laugh. And while all of this is going on, not a single policitian will do a consensus to determine what portion of the Vancouver and immediate surrounding areas is Chinekes or Chinekes owned. Fucking pathetic, Canada bowing down and fucking its own citizens over to make a bunch of Chinekes millionaires (and billionaires) happy, all for a few scraps of a couple thousand per millionaire.

"You do realize that the dinosaur depicted in Jurassic Park is the *Pachycephalosaurus,* which sounds like ""Paki"" but isn't based on a racial slur? Translated, it means ""thick headed lizard."" 

There *is* a species of dinosaur known scientifically as the *Pakisaurus* because its fossils were discovered in Pakistan. Dinosaurs are often named after the places where they were first discovered. For example, the *Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis* was named after the Mamenchi Ferry station where it was first found, as well as the Hochuan County where the second one was found. As FFGFM pointed out, the Nigersaurus was named after Niger, where it was originally found.

&gt; Yes, it very much did, which is why the gun crime rates have dropped so clearly over the last decade or so.

Gun crime rates dropped just as fast in the US over the past 20 years, and it's not because there are fewer on the streets.

You seemed to think they are connected.

&gt; aaand here it is. Why do you think that I want to completely ban weapons in the US? Seriously, why do you think that? I'm curious.

This whole thread has been about you praising the effectiveness of Australian gun bans. I didn't say completely ban weapons, I was looking at a ban comprable to what australia did, on some types. If you don't think we should enact that sort of legislation in the US why did you bring up australia in the first place?

"The cold is exhilarating. Whereas the summer heat is exhausting. I get this rush of energy and excitement when I step out into cold weather. Sometimes when I'm shivering I literally scream. I don't know... I think my adrenaline just really gets going.

I also sleep much better in cooler temps. In the summer I'm constantly tossing and turning trying to find the cold side of the bed. I try to keep from blasting the AC but I have 2 fans pointing directly at my bed, I sleep naked, and when it gets to be too unbearable I keep a spray bottle of water nearby to provide some temporary relief. When you get to a point where nothing is helping it's absolute torture. 

In the winter I just layer up on blankets, wear clothes to bed and I'm good. If I'm getting too warm I just roll over to a cold spot or remove a layer. If I'm too cold I add another layer. My bed isn't drenched in sweat and tears of frustration. "

"The Phoneix isnt just a luxury yacht like Ben and many other CIG employees have said over and over again.. I dont understand why people are still trying to spread this false rumor.

Heck even the luxury super yach 890 has a battle bridge and has been described as being a very viable command and control / captial ship in battles for small/medium sized orgs."
"I have to disagree with you for one reason alone: I recently discovered the label ""Dream Catalogue"" which seems to promote and identify itself with Vaporwave. However, I've found the music on this label to be infinitely more evocative, skillfully made, original and creative than the material most associate with the genre. That low-pitched, sample-intensive mall jazz style is completely abandoned in favor of ambient and surreal soundscapes that evoke naturalistic and dream-like imagery. It's a little more akin with the work of Oneohtrix Point Never in the sense that it abandons traditional structure for atmosphere and sonic exploration.

[2 8 1 4](https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/album/--18) is a good place to start - this project is a collaboration between telepath and Hong Kong Express, two ""vaporwave"" artists with discographies of their own. The album feels and sounds similar to the cover art - drifting into sleep by a rainy window exposing a neon-soaked Tokyo night in the future. This album was created entirely without samples - all of the sounds are original, and the atmosphere is immense. It's best absorbed as a whole (like all the releases on Dream Catalogue) but the sixth and final tracks are particularly special. The last track uses sounds of flowing water as a percussive instrument, accompanied by hi-hats tuned to resemble something like crickets on a lake. 

[CHESSMASTER](https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/album/--23) also had an excellent release on this label very recently. Rather than drifting into sleep, this album evokes being fully surrounded and swallowed in a surreal, eerie dream. If you could soundtrack the soul of a sentient machine, it would sound something like this album. The ninth track features wild percussion and drum sequencing, while the second track, like many on this album, utilizes vocal samples to create ice-cold atmosphere rather than melodic refrains.

The entire label's discography can be streamed and downloaded for free, and there's plenty more worth discovering on that bandcamp alone. ""Overgrowth"" feels like an empty and still forrest throughout, while the earlier CHESSMASTER album ""Angel"" skips between one overwhelming wall of sound to the next, with a pace so breakneck and overstuffed with ideas that it reminds me of a ambient Madvillainy.

Discovering this label lead to the realization that there is plenty of inspired and creative music that's labeled as ""vaporwave"" - a great example on the opposite end of the spectrum is [Blank Banshee,](https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/track/venus-death-trap) who fuses elements of trip-hop, jazz, chiptune and vaporwave in his favor. He doesn't sound entirely unlike Flying Lotus mashed with the sonic palette of a 1990s Windows startup disc. Hell, [the guy even sampled Donkey Kong Country](https://blankbanshee.bandcamp.com/track/eco-zones) tastefully in his newest project."

"Congrats on the feature!

Organize by scene and cut one scene at a time. I make 3 timelines per scene to start:

* “s01_stringout” - all the clips for that scene in shooting order
* “s01_selects” - a culled version of the stringout timeline with stuff that could potentially make it in the finished movie
* “s01_rev01” - a cut of the scene

Once you feel good about each scene on its own, start assembling reels. A feature is too long to work with on a single timeline. NLE performance, sharing with sound/color, exporting–all benefit from smaller chunks. Reels are a helpful way to break the movie up into more digestible pieces. Typically a reel is about 15-20 minutes long. 

Within each reel is where you can start making your scenes start to flow together. At this point, if you need to rework a scene, you can either just edit directly inside each reel or return to the scene timelines and cut new versions in. I find it gets confusing going back and forth, so once I bust into reel mode I usually stay there. Sometimes you want the flexibility of a less cluttered timeline though. Whatever works for you.

Set the timecode of each reel to reflect each reel number and put a 10 second countdown at the head with a 2 pop. Reel 01’s first frame of picture would be 01:00:00;00, Reel 02 would be 02:00:00;00, etc. 

This is the same with shorts, but be mindful of your audio tracks. Take whatever the most number of tracks recorded per clip is and treat that as an individual layer. So for example if your clips have at most 8 channels of audio, treat tracks 1-8 as one layer and if you have to overlap audio, use tracks 9-16. Designate consistent channels for SFX and music as well. Be consistent from reel to reel and your mixer will love you. 

There’s more stuff I’m forgetting, but hopefully that’s a helpful start. In general, organization is paramount. It's the same with shorts, but at the scale of a feature sloppiness can quickly get unmanageable, so do your best to work clean and you'll have a good time!"
"&gt;So is this 'women love assholes' line a rationalisation of the fact the girl you like rejected you 'she rejected me for him, but that's ok, he is just an asshole'

No. Asshole behavior is correlated with other behavior that women find attractive such as confidence and sexual forwardness. Asshole behavior works far better than pedestalization and beta orbiting, for instance: 

&gt;One day you pluck up the courage

LOL, fail. 

On the other hand, me taking first dates on a walk as an excuse to physically escalate, without getting explicit enthusiastic consent, leads to fuck-closing them on a regular basis. Not texting back because I'm out with other women, not changing my plans to meet their needs, being unavailable at times, leads to them becoming plates. In other words, by adopting the behaviors of a natural (a Chad), behaviors that my former beta self would dub assholish, I have multiple women wanting to fuck me. 

So am I an asshole? Think before you answer, 'cause the women like the new me...."

"If, 1000 people who make tanks are laid off and 1000 different people (who had been looking for work) were employed in that district building roads, schools, hospitals, etc. unemployment hasn't increased.

"FreeNAS operates fine without ECC. It does exactly the same thing with or without. 

**However**, and this is the big point, your data isn't fully protected without ECC. This is because FreeNAS/ZFS does most of it's operations in ram (thus the larger ram requirements over non-ZFS solutions) - so things like read/write, scrubbing, parity, snapshots...all the things that make ZFS great. Because it does those things in ram, it means that any errors in ram that go uncorrected can and probably will be written to disk, and thus have a chance of corrupting your data. When this happens in normal operation (ie playing a game or watching a video), it's not a big deal, as the worst that happens is you get a crash, and most of the time the system just recalculates and corrects it. Not so in file systems, where the damage can be real and permanent.

The main problem here, and what ECC is designed to address, is [bit-flips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error). That's when an electrical or magnetic field (ie radiation) causes a 0 to turn to a 1 or visa versa. Because it comes from an outside source, your computer has no idea that it's happened and will just continue on with the error in place, which is bad if you're a file system. What ECC does is add an extra layer to the process, wherein a parity chip (an actual extra chip on the ram) is used to ""double check"" the 1s and 0s and make sure they're right. That's why ECC is generally considered slower than non-ECC ram, because it's having to check everything before returning values (though as fast as ram is these days, the difference isn't something you'll notice). So ECC is generally preferred over non-ECC for ZFS, to prevent these errors from propagating into your file system.

That said, the chances of bit-flips are relatively low. They're generally caused by stuff like cosmic rays and radiation. For instance, a white paper from the International Space Station showed an average of 840 bit-flips a day due to cosmic rays. Without ECC ram being used, there's a good chance the whole thing would have crashed and burned due to an unrecoverable error...pretty good use of ECC there. On the other hand, down here where we're shielded by the atmosphere and don't have a high degree of background radiation (unless you live by Chernobel, then you'll need ECC for sure), bit-flips are a rare and illusive thing. One study from a large datacenter showed that in about 7 years, the manager identified 3 bit-flips for sure, and a handful of others that may or may not have been. I've personally run FreeNAS for a good long time without ECC and never once had an error. So you might be fine. You'll probably be fine. But you won't be 100% fine without ECC.

Bottom line, if what you're storing is important, irreplaceable data, get ECC, full stop. For my work machines, I run ECC, because it's worth the extra security. If it's a bunch of stuff you downloaded off the internet and can download again, get ECC to save you the trouble in the rare chance that a problem occurs, if your budget allows. If your budget doesn't allow, don't let lack of ECC stop you from running FreeNAS, if that's what you want to run.

&gt; I have read that ECC is not totally necessary but is better for ZFS. I think.

tl;dr - it's not necessary, but it's a good idea if your budget allows it."
"Everyone knows my point is the truth. there's a difference between legitimately really mean things, and trash-talk on games.

"If you ever come across [Händlmaier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4ndlmaier) sweet mustard, give it a try. It's one of, if not *the* best store bought sweet mustards I've ever had. It goes well with Leberkäse, a lot of sausages, and meat dishes but it also complements creamy, nutty cheeses very well. You want to get really weird? Try a breakfast roll (Brötchen) with peanut butter, Gruyère cheese and a dab of sweet mustard. Krensenf / Meerrettichsenf (mustard with horseradish) is not very popular around here (I'm a purebred north german Klippschieter), we prefer Dijon mustards in medium hot and hot. Kremser, Bautz'ner and Düsseldorfer are also nice and go very well with Bock- und Bratwurst. I... think I have to go eat something now. Something with mustard."

"I guess saying they aren't a real threat was too much, but I don't like their odds to take the division over the Hawks. I know it may seem brash but here me out. 

The Cardinals got totally fucked by injures to their QB's last year, it's true, really bad luck in that regard. but they also had (0.7/g) point differential for the season, 16th in the league (compared to (8.8/g) SEA 2nd in the league) They were in a lot close games that could have gone either way, mainly thanks to their 5th ranked defense. A defense that I believe over preformed talent wise and who also just lost their DC.

To rival the Hawks they will need Carson to be healthy for a full season this year and preforming well, which unfortunately given his health throughout his career and Arians style of offense is no guarantee.

This is starting to go long but I'll point out some things on the flip side, Seattle had a terrible first half of the season and if it weren't for us winning 10 in a row we could have missed the playoffs. I don't see that kind of start happening again, our offense was neutered by a revolving door of o-linemen, including playing 4 centers throughout the season, all while trying to incorporate the disaster that was Percy Harvin into our offense. Even though our line is no where the leagues best, it looks way more promising than what we had last season. we've added Gram and our wide receiving core has improved (no way they could be worse than last season). 

Our defense has a good chance at being able to match what they have done the last three seasons or be close, especially with a pass rush that looks more like the dominant one in our super bowl winning season than last year.

 I am obviously biased but I do acknowledge the Cards are the biggest competition in the division and could end up taking it, but on paper I think we are a much more talented team. 
You never know what's going to happen any given sunday and throughout a season but I believe we should be heavy favorites for the division at this point. "

"Addiction in general is largely characterized by two factors (and I suspect as time goes on, a third - genetics - will be identified):

1. An inability to stop in the face of mounting consequences. 
2. A tendency to escalate the behavior (the addiction becomes more and more intense as tolerance builds). 

OP's boyfriend hasn't seen any mounting circumstances yet. And who knows if there's been an escalating factor. 

So yes, it's possible that it could be addiction, but there's insufficient info here to be anywhere certain of that. 

Also I think your timeline is a touch out there. Once a week or once every three months? The Kinsey Institute (www.iub.edu/~kinsey/resources/faq.html) reports that among undergraduate students (i.e. OP's age) men masturbate an average of 12 times per month. Of that same grouping, those with partners engaged in sexual activity weekly or more at a rate of 75%.

If you're pissed off at someone, hearing ""Have another drink and drive yourself home / I hope there's ice on all the roads / And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt / And again when your head goes through the windshield,"" is great to yell at the top of your lungs."
"I've never experienced this myself but it sounds interesting.  I have seen all sorts of things but I've never gone to other planes before.

"Some random guy at Walmart started talking to me about this endurance race he was training for. He was obviously a little ""weird"", but he was a nice guy so I talked with him for a good 10mins.

"&gt; [Harry] had the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway.  
...  
""Let's go,"" called Hermione from halfway up the stone steps.  ""This isn't right, Harry, come on, let's go. . . .""  
She sounded scared, much more scared than she had in the room where the brains swam, yet Harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it...  
...  
[Harry] had just heard something.  There were faint whispering, murmuring noises coming from the other side of the veil.  
""What are you saying?"" he said very loudly, so that the words echoed all around the surrounding stone benches.  
""Nobody's talking, Harry!"" said Hermione, now moving over to him.  
...  
""I can hear them too,"" breathed Luna, joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil.  ""There are people *in there*!""  
""What do you mean, '*in there*'?"" demanded Hermione, jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted.  ""There isn't any '*in there*,' it's just an archway, there's no room for anybody to be there -- Harry, stop it, come away --""  
...  
""Sirius,"" Harry repeated, still gazing, mesmerized, at the continuously swaying veil.  
...  
On the other side, Ginny and Neville were staring, apparently entranced, at the veil too.  Without speaking, Hermione took hold of Ginny's arm, Ron Neville's, and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door.  
""What d'you reckon that arch was?"" Harry asked Hermione as they regained the dark circular room.  
""I don't know, but whatever it was, it was dangerous,"" she said firmly, again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door.

Just last week I saw a post of a developer that thought there was chat implemented into the game for users to be able to type to one another.

It is this kind of development that will run this game into the ground, just like every other attempt at this genre...."

The closer the wire segment is to the power source, the more current it will have to carry.

"As said below you have contingencies and a placement stop plan.  I'm a civil engineer working at a major US project with many mass concrete placements - several of which have taken 20 hours or more.  On a job like this (and the one I'm working) they'll have an onsite batch plant so the placement rate will be dictated by the pump rate and batch plant capacity.  You have plans in place for a lot of different contingencies (loss of power at the batch plant, extra drivers, extra trucks, extra pumps, how to handle various failures, etc) but if it all goes to shit, you might have to just stop placing concrete.

A typical plan for that (for instance, plan B and plan C and whatever fail) on my project is to use what concrete you have left
to level out the surface, then roughen the surface in the same manner as the planned construction joints.  At that point you have to go back to the design engineer and find out if that unplanned construction joint is acceptable or not (if it's not, you might have to excavate out the concrete and re-place portions).

What you don't do, however, is keep placing on top of a cold joint.  If you have a cold joint (and the concrete placement crews will *know* they have a cold joint - trust me.  If you somehow forgot to come back around and the concrete sets up beyond being able to get it back alive with vibration, you stop the placement as described above."

"We settled with Insightly. We liked it because it's not expensive (depending on what version you buy), because it can integrate with our stock/order system, and because of the google sidebar app. 

We tried it for the free trial period. It came down to Salesforce, Insightly, and Base CRM. Salesforce said it was overkill, Base CRM's email tool wasn't very functional plus it didn't have an app that linked in with gmail, and Insightly won out for the reasons I stated above. "
"A concealed weapon isn't really for getting into shootouts in public. It's more for being able to defend yourself if someone threatens you with a knife or their bare hands. Most people aren't trained to fight like Marines, so a gun would be their only means of defense. For example, a woman who is being stalked by an ex boyfriend that is walking back home after work."
"I always liked computer games over console games, right from the beginning.

I paid for and installed it all by myself. The first real computer I build was from spare computer parts at the college I attended. It had a pentium 4 processor, 1GB of ram, and no video card. I didn't have enough money for a new computer, and I wanted one for papers and stuff. Junior year I bought a Lenovo Y470 laptop and consider this to be my ascension. Three years later I built the computer above.

"not really necessary as long as you pay attention to the map and understand your limitations.  Morello+athenes is strong though, its not maximizing early/mid damage, but come late game its worth it.

The thing about veigar is that he is a late game carry who mauls people, however, he is still impactful in the mid game due to his scaling, ult, and Huge CC ability.  

Normally, morello and athenes is somewhat wasteful as you are not maximizing your damage, but remember, veigar with 40% cdr is terrifying.  You can easily stack 50-100 ap to make up for whatever damage bonus you get with other weapons.

"&gt; The perpetuation of misogyny requires men to internalize certain ideas that are harmful to themselves, therefore ending endemic misogyny would be beneficial to men.

This is a convenient reframing of men's issues as mere side-effects of women's issues.

Men's issues have little to do with misogyny. They are due to the lack of empathy for men, the assumption of male hyperagency, the punishment of gender non-conforming men and perpetuation of negative stereotypes of men.

You have demonstrated why I don't believe that feminism can help men. 

When feminists acknowledge men's issues, most of them do so only to promote the idea women are oppressed. Everything men suffer is simply evidence of their domination of women.

Most of the rhetoric from feminism displays complete obliviousness to the social forces which harm men. This work frames everything as power imbalance (always with men holding more power) and misogyny. Men's issues don't fit this model (I""d arge that many women's issues don't either but that's a different discussion). If you can't comprehend the real causes of the problem you can't really address it."

"Texan here! I literally went from not knowing how to use a gun to having passed the CHL written/shooting requirements in 8 hours. The background check didn't take long, and I literally had my license in my hand maybe a month after learning how to shoot. 

**THIS IS A PROBLEM!**

**Background:** my dad was a gun smith, and I literally grew up around guns (like most Texans). I was never particularly interested in guns, and my father never forced me to shoot one; he did require that I learn that guns need to be respected, and I should never touch one without proper training from him or someone else. I had no interest; so, I never touched a gun. When he died unexpectedly I felt incredibly guilty because teaching his darling girls to shoot was something he always wanted to do. I miss him everyday and getting a CHL was something I wanted to do to honor him. The instructor held two classes one after the other: a beginning class (people who have never touched a gun before) and a CHL certification class. I felt good after taking the class and meeting the requirements but didn't touch another gun for months. My birthday came around, and my mother wanted to buy me a gun for protection. I had a CHL; so I thought it was a good idea. I had a freaking break down in the store when I couldn't pull the gun open (I knew the terminology when I took the test, but that was a while ago) to check the chamber/load it. I still do not own a gun and will not until I get more training. The moral of this story is not what a stupid girl I am. It is that no one SHOULD be able to own a gun without proper training. Not just 8 hours. I mean a lot of training. Guns are a way of life in Texas, and I acknowledge that many people grow up with proper training. Maybe we should blame the guy who certified me because I clearly was not ready - well I did score the highest in the class at the shooting range...but still. I do not feel good about how easy it was for me (or how easy it will be for other unqualified citizens) to get a CHL."

"Well, a significant reason why Chelsea in particular, has not bothered to try to promote youth enough, is because they have been shuffling managers for the last decade, so it's hard to develop these players when each manager will rate the players differently. For instance, McEachran was played a lot under Ancelotti, and then he was never given a chance in the first team after that. "
"I think you're a little bit misinformed about how this works. Having smaller amount of teams that can compete is actually bigger advantage since points divide less. Points of Italian teams divide for 6 teams, and for England for 8 teams, so England gets lesser points for same win.

 Look at this, if Italian team wins a game in CL groupstage against some opponent they'll get more points for Italy than if English team does the same."
"Feel like this chapter went a little too far with the ""Rules don't apply to you if you're good and heroic"" schtick.

It was one thing when it was just passing an entrance exam. He had what the school was looking for so they made an exception over his test score. It happens.

This though. If there are laws doing hero work without the appropriate training, then this is exactly the sort of situation those laws are designed for. A more qualified hero would've apprehended the criminal without hospitalizing him, or at least followed proper protocol so that everybody knew Stain's injuries were unavoidable.

Most grievously of all, there were numerous properly trained heroes on hand throughout the whole fiasko. Iida was on duty, down the street from his mentor's base of operations. They surely have proper protocol for when one of their heroes in training finds their supervisor has been taken out. Deku had to leave Gran Torino in order to go chasing after the crime scene he suspected was in progress. Then, conveniently was only able to contact even more untrained aspiring heroes for reinforcement. Todoroki then left Endeavor behind to chase after his friend's distress signal.

Because every step of the way they chose to tackle this problem without supervision we ended up with this act of vigilante brutality.

Endeavor likely should be penalized too, for allowing a student under his supervision to just bugger off like that.

By this standard the laws around superheroism don't even matter at all. Sure, it says you're not supposed to do hero work unless you're properly trained, but the act of doing hero work also provides a get out of jail free card exempting you from any laws you may be breaking in the process, even if you're clearly exactly why those laws exist in the first place."
"Nice job copying and pasting the definition off google

Thats a very vague phrase and difficult to interpret, 

When they say ""would not normally commit"" its not exclusive to a cop walking up to a random person on the street and the cop asking him to sell his crack and offering him a percent of the profit  

it can be an actual drug dealer being asked by a cop to sell his crack for a percent of the profit too.  

when they say ""not normally commit"" it means that the person didn't walk out their door and say ""Im gonna go call someone to sell me a sellable amount of crack today"" "

"I don't know. To me, your response just sounds like a re-hash of the same argument that I've already heard. By and large, of course. the first paragraph of it does bring something new to the problem of evil debate which I haven't heard.

Let's take a look at the purpose of Original Sin. This response seems to contend that Original Sin exists to purify us and make us worthy of heaven. An obstacle to overcome. However, when God first created man, we WERE worthy of heaven. There was never a need to purify us. It's only after the apple incident that we had to worry about Original Sin.

"Gotta disagree.  I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure how the ""rape as entertainment"" is portrayed. However one of the biggest YA series of the last year centered around a world that annually sent children into an arena to fight to the death, so it's not as if complex themes aren't explored in YA.

That said, even if we dislike her book or the subject matter, her larger message about queer diversity in fantasy is valid and worth reading."
"It bothered me too because I was excited to see his daughter and hear about dad-James, but I'm guessing that his daughter is staying with her mother, and since they are exes who knows what their relationship is like.

"I'm not gonna get into whether or not Crawford is an average goalie because in my mind that's one of those fun sports debates where both sides have a real case for their positions. That being said, average goalies can totally win the Jennings. Especially when you take into account that two goalies on the same team often win together, so long as they both hit the minimum GP requirement. Halak has one, Roman Turek has two, hell the first time Crawford won it Ray Emery was also included as a winner. It's also worth noting that even the definition of the award says ""the goaltender(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it ... based on regular-season play."" Team is right there in the criteria. 

I don't know whether you're right or wrong, but if it was me making the case for Crawford's excellence, I wouldn't use the Jennings as the lynchpin of my argument.

"Sometimes u/myvirginityisstrong, when a man and a woman love one another very dearly they do ""grown up stuff."" That can mean a lot of things. For instance, a woman may ask a man to shit on her chest and sit in it. We call that a Cleveland steamer. Fire a load into it and you've got yourself a delectable Boston cream-pie! And sometimes a man will ask an aggressive woman in high heels to stomp on his testicles repeatedly in order to achieve the ultimate climax. These things are just part of the natural progression of the human cycle of sexual fantasy, and must be regarded as such. I hope I've cleared things up for ya, little feller!"
"it doesn't really. A normal hero with 200 Attack speed requires 200 IAS to double their dps, assuming they don't have any extra attacks (e.g. Moment of Courage). Weaver with 200 Attack speed requires 260 IAS to double his overall dps.

whereas both weaver and a Juggernaut will require 150 damage to double their dps if their current attack damage is 150.

It's not that IAS is bad on weaver it's just not as efficient as it is on other heroes whereas attack damage still is."

"There is nothing wrong with RNG posts other than they do nothing for anyone. 
We have deduced there are hot zones for summoning, random number generators are actually a myth to some degree according to this theory.
What needs to be done to benefit the community would be creating an additional locked subforum consisting of 24 threads alone, 1 for each hour in the day. Perhaps even 24 per day of the week, which have not been tested by us. Within the threads will contain members postings of their summons inside each respective time stamp, rather than just spamming the dokkan forum with a bunch of useless screenshots.
From this we can further isolate the hot zones and rule out the inaccuracies within the theory, as much as possible as while rng is not completely random, it still is not an exact science. 
The trends we have noticed are the ssj goku appearing for sr and ssr pulls tend to mostly happen around the korin tower windows, early in the day then late in the evening. There could be more..but to find them we would need a massive amount of contributors as well as the rerollers adding their ss of when ssj appears to do their summoning in addition to when the standard black haired goku grants similar luck. This will also aid in ensuring rerollers waste less time.
Many of you will disagree with everything stated here while having minimal experience in the subject, which is fine. You can continue believing there are no trends within your rngesus system. The informed among us will continue summoning at the right time to get decent pulls while you will continue stocking up on Rs. I wont be responding to any stupid questions or ignorant comments, this info and proposal is for you. Ive used all my stones already and wont be making another account. 
Lastly, in regards to your concern over the dokkan sub feeling dead, perhaps if this idea Ive proposed takes off then rng related posts will still be prevalent within the sub while all the rngesus screenshots and discussion of will be in an appropriate seperate sub within this sub. I dont even know how possible that is under this coding, just a mere idea to give all dokkan players an edge or heightened chance of pulling really good cards. That end result is all that really matters, everything else was just the system I feel would work most efficiently to achieve that goal."

"**241. Margaret Bobonich, Guatemala (13th)**

So, Margie B plays a fairly important role in the pre-merge of Guatemala. Because this is one of the most brutal seasons ever, they kick things off with an overnight 11-mile hike, which is gruelling on basically everyone, especially the Nakum tribe. Blake gets sick from poison ivy, Bobby Jon collapsed, Judd got extremely sick and Jim tore his bicep, so Margaret, a nurse is able to help the tribe with the injuries sustained from the hike, helping them win the reward of a shelter.

After that, Margaret's story tapers off a bit until we get to the swap, where Rafe, Steph, Jamie and Lydia go over to join Margaret, Brooke, Cindy and Judd. However, since Judd wasn't secure with his old tribemates, he flips to join the Yaxha's quickly and votes out Brooke, which displeases Marge.

Then we get the next episode, which is a fantastic episode and I'll fight anyone about that. We get the reward challenge where Judd manages to almost single-handedly win reward for his tribe, which was a barbecue with beer. As a result, Judd has a few beers before heading to the double tribal, and the Nakum tribal is probably a top 10 tribal, maybe top 5. Because Margaret is now on the chopping block, she decides to needle Judd throughout the day and tribal in an attempt to cause him to blow up and turn the rest of the tribe against him. To the audience's benefit, he does blow up and sticks his foot in his mouth at least three times. Unfortunately for Margie B, this isn't enough and she goes home, but not without a great confessional:

&gt; Judd... you're a bully, you're self-righteous, you're rude, you're profane. And, for all those reasons, you've probably gotten this far. However, no one like you deserves a million dollars. My vote's for you, buddy.

"Again, see the context of the discussion to understand. The commenter essentially said this was not an individual right. I pointed out the driving mechanism behind the amendment; i.e. what is needed to understand it. Without the fear of a disarmed populace, there is no reason to have the second amendment.

I am not asking the U.S. to send troops, but some weapons would be nice. But, the E.U. (not including the EU) has no obligation to help Ukraine and I understand why they won't.

"Most of our students don't have an interest in working at a studio as engineers. We are more artist-based and artist focused. What I would suggest is to make sure this is what you want to do, because it's very different than being an artist/producer. A lot of young artists get fooled thinking because it's in the studio, it's closer to their goals. But working on other people's music is a completely different perspective than creating your own. However, if you do want to go to a studio, the main thing they are looking for is hunger. You have to be willing to do anything at any time. Hunger will always progress your status in the pack. 
It's been awesome to see Jauz' rise and how quick it's happened, along with all the students out there following their dreams.

It's mean, it's fast, it's super easy to learn and it's a blast!"
"I started back this past Monday and I was overwhelmed. 

My online class was a bit scattered (new instructor is new to the University) but I think it's going to even out over the next two weeks.

The classroom class was frustrating after having been in the job market. So many distracting questions and jokes when all I wanted was to get the material, understand it, and get out of there at a reasonable time. 

Instead, I grew impatient with jokes/questions asking about mandatory attendance, what was going to be on exams (specifics), requests for extra credit ""just because"" and other crap. I forgot how much of a pain in the ass young people can be (when I was one of them.) 

**Best advice** - study that syllabus and get as far ahead as you can manage. Don't let the workload get ahead of you. Waiting until the last minute will cause stress and impact your grade. You're an adult now- this is your new job. Plan accordingly and deliver the best performance possible. "
hey man regals are a super good hookah brand. i have 3 of them myself. and the owner who i have personal talked to is always very helpful he made me a custom blue regal about a year ago. i can send a pic if you want to see the condition of them i have noticed that the ball valves are inconsistent but besides that they are the best 10/10 for sure.

"I don't disagree that women face discrimination in this country, but i believe there is a lot of extreme feminism in this country right now and thats what scares me. It scares me to see people getting riled up about misconstrued facts, because of what they may have experience. You can see this happening with the Black Lives matter group as well. Both groups i support, but when you start perpetuating the thing that you denounce, then you are causing nothing but chaos"
"I'm not associated with Elcomsoft, but I came across this just now and didn't find any mention of this backdoor on reddit at all, let alone on /r/netsec.

"a while ago I made a list of people who would be affected by my death. the list had 3 poeple on it. the list has since been shortened to just 1 person, him.

he is my only friend and the only person who I will ever love. without him i have nothing. and i dont see a point in suffering the rest of my life without him."

"They have low-yield nuclear devices, and they have ballistic missiles.  The one in your photo is, I believe, the Taepo Dong II missile, which has a fairly respectable range.  The problem North Korea has is making their nuclear devices small enough to fit into these missiles.  There is no evidence that NK has been able to do that, but they have tested nuclear devices in 2006, 2009, and 2013, each time getting it better and better.  It's only a matter of time before the threat becomes credible."
"I haven't watched the ending for a while, but I've always thought people misread that line. It isn't ""the created will always rebel against their creators"" as in ""all created will always rebel against their creators"", it's ""it will always be the case that the created rebel against their creators"".

The difference being that there isn't actually any contradiction between what the Catalyst is saying and any individual case of synthetics cooperating with their creators."

"Dude, exactly. There is close to zero character development or characterization in video games outside of cliches, because  they are meant for the player to self-insert. The plot and themes are also bare-bones because they are only a vehicle for the gameplay. Could you imagine how boring and predictable it would be watching Borderlands 2 in theatres for example? Sure some writers and good actors could make it better, but why not use that talent for more creative or original stuff?"

"&gt; is a status quo they're okay with, and the HL is dying inside.

The concept that the LL is happy carefree and the HL is the only one suffering is not correct in every case (but I see a lot of that opinion here). I have a much lower libido than average and I ALWAYS am just as miserable as my HL partners. There is guilt for not being able to provide. Pain when they experience the pain of rejection. Misery during ""maintenance sex."" More often than not, the LL person is suffering just as much.

&gt; There are plenty of posts of HLs trying everything they can think of, and there's no change. The LL just doesn't want sex.

It would be great if we could get a matching post from the spouse each time someone accounted ""their side"" of the relationship. Frustration often leads to misunderstanding or misrepresentation of another's point of view. 

&gt; I'm sure it isn't. How often would there be sex if it was up to you, as the LL, in the absence of whining etc. Do you think whining happens where both sides are having sex as often as they want, +/-25%?

This difference will vary widely based on why someone is LL, but here's the response from my POV. I masturbate about twice a week so I would say my libido is around there. 

But if I'm laying in bed with my partner and they initiate sex without me being horny, and I refuse and they whine, then whining isn't going to make me horny. It's going to irritate me. It's going to make me lose a level of respect for my partner. Now I've lost respect for my partner, and I'm not aroused, and the next time they proposition sex, the cycle repeats. So this cycle continues where the HL partner is hurt by the constant refusal, and I'm turned off by the whining. The only thing to be gained by whining and pestering is annoyance from the person on the receiving end - a completely unproductive response. 

Instead, if my partner initiates and I refuse, I would much prefer that they take it without whining. It doesn't justify the DB problem, it doesn't mean that the HL is giving in, but it means that the HL person isn't adding annoyance because of the whining on top of the problems that already exist. "
"I agree. The problem with Vive fanboys (not Vive fans) is that their own subforum(s) activity is slow, almost dead on some days and weeks. They have multiple subforums and it's still slow.

"I agree with this, unfortunately even questions that can be answered easily with one or two verses (and include the verses) will include many more verses out of context. 

I asked a question regarding landmarkism and they really didn't provide much in the realm of sources, and the book they did recommend for ""recommended reading"" was given an abysmal rating on Amazon. 

I chalk it up to the large number of questions that need answered, but that's kinda the point. Having proper answers is critical; and with no real Greek (or Hebrew) included, it suffers at times."
"Obviously with HiRez we should all take the 'continuing support' bit with a ~~grain~~ brick of salt, but its nice to hear that that is being mentioned as apart of this update. Even if its a really small team, at this point I'd just take any amount of dedicated resources as a win."
"First off I see that you have Hart in goal. While he is probably going to be one of the most stalwart keepers in the league, it takes up one of those 3 valuable City spaces which could be much better invested in defence. I recommend Kolarov (now that Clichy is out he will be first-choice for the next 6-8 weeks) or Kompany (pretty much nailed on each week bar injury/suspension). I would recommend replacing Hart with either Mignolet (who has a decent run of home games coming up) or Courtois (who is a decent pick even if his fixtures aren't jaw-dropping). So, moving on to defence I would reccomend swapping out Cedric for the City defender as his upcoming fixtures aren't that good. Midfield looks good although I would swap out Silva for Yaya who is cheaper and will probably get more points **in the near future** than Silva. Albrighton is a bit meh but I suspect he is just in there to save funds. If this is the case then there are also alternative differentials such as Nathan Redmond who has got at least 6 points in every one of his first 3 games. Front line looks decent but try swapping out Pelle for one of Gomis, Benteke or Lukaku as they are going to continue their scoring in the coming weeks. Lastly on the subs you should try swapping out Hennessey for McCarthy as Hennessey will not start. This may not matter that much as Speroni is coming back soon but it is not good to have a non-starter in case hart is injured/suspended.

Of course, none of these changes should be made this week unless you are WCing but try to spread them out over the next couple of weeks.

Hope I could help!"
"But you're comparing *growth*. In the year 2000, Microsoft had less room to grow than the average company in the Nasdaq/SP500/wever.

"One problem you might be facing is the ""support rule"" in the matchmaking: If one team has a support, the other one will have a support as well. That is a big issue for Tyrande and Tassadar since they are both a bit (or a bit more) weak on the healing side and healing is stronger than other support-y stuff. So if you're solo-supporting as Tyrande against a Malfurion, he'll simply negate all of your team's damage while their team's damage is pretty much permanent since you cannot keep up with the healing.

To mitigate this problem you have two options from which one is pretty great and the other one an excuse of a workaround... First, try queueing with a ""real"" healer. This leaves you open for the utility support role. Uther seems to be a great pick since you both have good burst heal and supplement each other with just more healing. I've also successfully run a Tyrande/Malfurion combo because Tyrande can make up for the lack of burst healing (at least a bit) and Malf just delivers the raw healing power of his heals over time. With this setup you are able to excel at zoning, stunning, making vulnerable and adding dps while your team still does not lack healing power.

The workaround is to take healing talents and try to be a healer. It'll not be perfect by far, but you can out-heal Uther's Q after lvl13. He'll still have his W and R in addition to that and out-heal you in total, but you can at least make your team compete: With overflowing light she does very similar healing (just about 25 HP less healing at lvl20) on an 8 sec cooldown compared to Uther's Q at 12 sec for half (or even a third if you took celestial attunement) of the mana-cost. Additionally she can take battle momentum, lowering her cooldowns so that she can spam her Q like nobody's business (if she was constantly attacking the cooldown would be around 5 sec). It'll most certainly not make you the best healer in the world, but your team might have a fighting chance - and all only a the cost of 2-3 talent choices, leaving the other tiers for boosting that utility you bring to the table."

1) When I have found caches without a pen in it and I didn't bring one along or if the log is full and I don't have any to replace it with, I have taken a picture of me holding the cache as ""proof"" of the find before but I generally try to avoid doing so on ones that I can easily come back to another day.

2) I rarely find swag I like but still tend to bring bags of mcdonald's toys and random trinkets I find at Goodwill/garage sales or make and leave them without taking anything. When I do actually take something, I personally don't feel as bad with equal exchange since I'm generally filling caches up with stuff for others to find more often than not. For whatever it's worth, cool rocks and minerals are generally something I would trade out for.

"It's true, we don't know if all gem tech is made from sentient gems. Pearl claims that Lapis was found by the galaxy warp, so unless she was lying (she could be), lapis was trapped by homeworld after being poofed and cracked. If pearl was lying, then yes, lapis was a PoW. 

Lapis described her time in the mirror as work, when steven asked, so she clearly saw it as slavery. Then again, she talked about being trapped later, so I suppose it's like prison and slavery at the same time! What fun!

As far as varieties of gems, that still only adds up to thousands of gems total. I suppose that's possible, considering how powerful gems are. But it also begs the question, why would they need to colonize other worlds, then? Why build the kindergartens, when one world could easily sustain them. Because a few thousand life forms that don't eat or breathe could sustain themselves on one world forever.

The pyro will deal normal hit damage, but you instantly end the afterburn, which means they can then re-ignite your allies, which you can then extinguish, and so on.

Whilst your allies are competent enough, you can farm the shit out of failed pyro attacks. Even long range afterburn damage such as from flare guns and the cow mangler can be turned into massive damage potential."

"Canada has a very small population. If we are 10th in the world, then our jobs created per capita from the production of motor vehicles, is probably much higher than that. 

The cost of cars to the consumer will likely not be significant. They might go down a little bit, but the car companies will continue to charge what canadians are willing to pay. 

If the prices drop significantly, and profits don't increase, then the only real advantage that the companies would have in doing so would be creating domestic jobs, which is probably not something they are terribly interested in, particularly as it will incur a cost in infrastructure, and also wages will go up slightly, as job supply increases and worker supply remains constant. 

So, the companies must be planning significant profit increases which will be greater than the cost in the long run. That means your cars probably won't be cheaper, and canadians will have less money to purchase them with, as per the lack of the money multiplier from lack of jobs, and money in the hands of canadians. 

You have to be very careful with trade agreements. There are many factors that come into play. There is depletion of resources, the future, jobs, all of that stuff. 

But you want a good flow of exports and imports. It's pretty tricky. 

I think producing cars here is better for canadians, all other things being equal. I am not familiar with the details of the TPP though, to have much of an opinion on the rest of it. It could very well be that losing jobs in that market might be worth it. Perhaps we might decide to fund projects that can make use of the skilled labour, and unskilled labour experience in those fields, and our economy will profit from other clauses in the agreement. 

It is complex. For things like this, you want a government you can trust, that will look at all the options correctly, that you don't have to rely on canadians looking at every detail. 

I don't think we have one of those right now. I don't trust Harper at all. But not wanting car production to leave the country is actually sensible imo.

* It boots in less than 30 seconds (on a regular HDD)

* The main speakers and headphone jack were seperated into 2 different sound devices (they were merged before). I like to use some bass boost (included with Windows sound enhancements) on my earbuds, but when I unplugged them, the main speakers would just sound quieter. With 2 devices, the effect now only applies to the headphones, while the main speakers remain at full volume, without having to toggle it on and off all the time

"I'm angry SJWs have coopted the name and sullied it. It makes it all 100x harder for anyone to take ""feminists"" seriously. I mentioned this in a comment earlier but I feel a lot of people (both genders) are confused about what ""equality"" means.

Feminists just want the autonomy to make decisions about themselves. The gender roles thing gets thrown around a lot but all it *should* mean is that if a woman focuses on her career you don't have people shaming her for not having a family. Similarly, if a man chooses to be a SAHD people should be ok with that and not make him feel emasculated.

Of course it runs deep but if there were one thing I could really get out there is that feminism is less about *specific* inequalities but *general* inequalities. With the wage gap it's not that a male doctor gets paid 13 cents more on the dollar, it's the fact that the low paying jobs are typically female-oriented careers. It's not that feminists think all men are rapists in waiting, just that we want more respect for things other than our bodies and appearance. How many idiotic articles have you seen talking about some female politician's sex appeal? Far too many. It gets old."

"**Credit:** FenrisOrson

**God:** Chang'e

**Role:** Preferably mid, but solo can work

**Starter:** Vamp Shroud (You want to keep the extra 700 gold)

**Build:** CDR Boots&gt; Book of Thoth&gt; Breastplate if Valor&gt; Lotus Crown&gt; Rod of Tahuti &gt; Spear of the Magus

**Actives:** Greater Blink, Purification Beads

**Summary:** The strategy of this build is to get Chang'e to mid/late game where she thrives. You start with just Vamp Shroud and keep the 700 gold in hand, once you have 800 gold (you should have this much after clearing red) use your bunny to buy Soul Stone. This build is more about survivability and sustain as opposed to straight burst, hence the 40% CDR and double defensive items. Blink is key so that you can initiate a team fight or counter initiate. 

**Situational Items:** 
1. CDR Boots can be swapped with Pen Boots at your discretion
2. Chronos Pendant and BoV are interchangeable 
3. Lotus Crown can be swapped for any defensive/utility item. Divine Ruin, Gem of Iso and Ethereal Staff are all nice options
4. Spear of the Magus can be swapped with Obsidian Shard, Void Stone or Soul Reaver, any of these can work"

"Honesty, when LoTR was made Peter Jackson hated the idea of a traditional wizard magic fight. He's said so openly in behind the scenes interviews.

For example, he really wanted the Saruman vs Gandalf fight to be more like two old men beating the shit out of eachother, instead of a flashy wizards' duel.

"Well, it's interesting, I guess, because effective patient care requires patient cooperation, so it puts us as physicians immediately at odds with some patients who either don't wish to discuss their weight or reject out of hand discussions of obesity that imply that they were somehow responsible (some, not all, lots of overweight patients are plenty happy to agree). The truth of it is that obesity in and of itself is not a disease state if you want to split hairs, just like hypertension (high blood pressure) isn't a disease either (for sake of simplicity) but instead they are markers and risk factors of disease. This puts us in a bind, however, because people don't just have a disease called ""heart attacks,"" so we gather up all the data that tells us such-and-such quantitative data tells us this observable metric is predictive of the disease you're actually worried about.

They're right in the sense that it is certainly possible that an overweight person does not, in a strict sense, die from being overweight, much like on a day to day basis, smoking a cigarette will not cause your death unless you catch yourself on fire. Compare that to, say, drug overdoses that directly cause death, which are a much easier teaching example. It devolves into a debate on semantics, sometimes, but a lot of times we make certain compromises to keep patients in the fold since it is better having them get regular care even if they're not fully compliant. That's something that honestly could have been a positive perspective of the ""healthy at any size"" movement like ""don't give up on these recommendations just because you're severely overweight,"" because really, how easy would be it be to justify completely giving up once you're already 100lbs overweight? What's a little more? Even when you cut back heavily and you stop the out of control gaining but end up reaching equilibrium where you now are maintaining the weight, it creates a feeling that your efforts to resist what is by then a trained response to overeat are going to waste. I've read some papers that suggest that the hormonal regulation takes something like three to six months to reach a new ""normal,"" which is a lot longer than most diets last. "
"Did he claim the front door was ajar, or that he had reason to believe someone was in immediate danger? Absent a warrant, or actively chasing a suspect, that would be the only reason law enforcement can enter your home without permission. And while it's certainly possible your door wasn't actually ajar, and he did not hear anything indicating someone was in trouble, you can bet that's probably what he's going to claim. 

You can contact your local sheriff's department to find out precisely why he entered, and file a complaint against the deputy.

"Man kann sich natürlich vorstellen, wie Österreich aussehen würde, wenn sich die Bevölkerung in den letzten 30 Jahren verdoppelt hätte. Der Punkt ist: Das war aber nicht der Fall. Stattdessen haben Leute in Nachfolge Hans Kelsens ein politisches System geschaffen, das die Stabilität des Landes sicherstellt. Wer sich nebenbei darüber beschwert, dass die Länder politischen Einfluss haben sollte bedenken, aus welchen Gründen ihnen dieser Einfluss zugestanden wurde. 

Das Video ist zwar ganz nett und schön, ignoriert aber zwei wesentliche Punkte. Erstens: Österreich hat ebenso wie andere europäische Staaten keine Verantwortung dafür, dass Staaten mit gewissen gesellschaftlichen Merkmalen nicht so recht zu funktionieren scheinen. Es läge an diesen Staaten selbst, diese Merkmale in einem Säkularisierungsprozess abzulegen. Zweitens: Staaten und Gesellschaften können gegen eine kaum begrenzte Zuwanderung sein, vor allem, wenn fraglich ist, inwieweit die Zuwanderer die Grundwerte des Staats teilen."

Likewise with Chris Christie.

"It doesn't change the fact that rushing QBs get devalued in 6 pt per TD leagues. The overall rushing matters because when you have a large chunk of your points coming from rushing that stays static while the portion from your passing TDs goes up 40-80 points.

Here's a chart I made:

http://i.imgur.com/zrf3uhe.png

As you can see in the % Difference column, pocket passers improve a lot more in 6pt per TD leagues than rushing QBs do. All I'm saying is when you're drafting for a 6 point per TD league you need to devalue rushing QBs in your rankings."
"&gt; Chinese government fans nationalistic hatred towards Japan whenever there's domestic turmoil.

This was not the case in the 1990s. In fact, a lot of people did not know Japanese Emperor Akihito paid friendly visit only to one foreign country, that was China in 1992 (or 1994 I can not remember). People also forgot in the early days when HK people visit Diaoyu island, the Chinese government was trying to discourage that type of behaviors.


The America bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, is the single most important event that changed balance in Chinese government. From 1999 it is a different world in both West and China.


That being said, I think the only long term solution is to establish trust among Chinese-Japanese-American people and build the relation based on friendship and mutual understanding and respect. They will always be competitors to some degree, that does not mean they have to be enemies. "

"You know what, you are *absolutely* right; that is an utterly FANTASTIC idea. Let's all hate the same people who risk their lives every single day to uphold the country's laws and to do their very best to keep the innocent safe while under ever-constant scrutiny from tens of millions of strangers - many who don't even live in the U.S., might I add - who flip their shit and instantly believe that every cop/agent we have is a corrupt, power-abusive asshole the very moment that just one or two of their peers out of over 1 million sworn in total do something bad (I say the word ""strangers"" because people who know most police officers have respect for what they do due to the fact that they understand what their job really entails). People who, might I add, probably have never been in the shoes of a law enforcement officer and can even fathom how demanding of a job they have, and say that we should record every little thing they do 24/7 to be the watch dogs of our nation because we have some sort of fascist police force secretly running our country and oppressing us. I realize it's the cool and trendy thing nowadays to hate cops and say ""fuck the police"" like you're N.W.A back in 1988 or something, but at some point you may decide to grow up and put on your big boy pants when you realize that that kind of attitude is the one that gets you in legal trouble when you refuse to cooperate with the men and women who, at any point in time, can decide to just up and quit their jobs and may not be there to save your sorry ass one day when you're in mortal danger.

Oh yeah, and one more thing: the overall majority of people who are shot and killed by policemen/women are the morons who do something incredibly stupid like coming at them with a weapon even or get into a shootout with them after they've been warned multiple times to drop it and get down on the ground or face the consequences, because that's the standard procedure for dealing with a deadly suspect. If you really hate cops so much and want to do something about it, why don't you just grab the largest steak knife from your kitchen, charge at the first cop you see in your neighborhood and let me know how that works out for you when you wake up in the hospital with a nice, shiny nine-millimeter bullet in your chest after you've been shot in self-defense and an awesome felony charge waiting for you in court for the attempted murder of a law enforcement official (if they don't actually kill you first for being a complete dumbass like they should, that is). Or, even better, try living in a place like Mexico where the majority of cops and their superiors actually *are* corrupt and won't even give you a warning before they break into your home and kill you and your whole family in your sleep because you managed to piss off someone in the Mexican government who's been paid off by the drug cartels that practically run the whole damn country."

"No mention of that in the [Fate SRD](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects) either. My guess is that they got it mixed up when writing the cheat sheet (the next option they cover is increasing the difficulty of a source of passive opposition), and the card's text was probably copied from the former.

I would say: go ahead and spend any points you want against active opposition; just remember the rest of the rules, like not invoking the same aspect twice unless one of those invocations is free."
"Let's bring back Black and White bathrooms. Why bother letting women vote?

"You're on the right path. As for myself, and all my producer friends, we started on a demo of Fruity Loops, knew nothing about anything, and 12 years later we are making decent music. 

I was a kid, so I didn't understand the scope of what goes into production, nor did I really care. We were all having fun. It would have been *really* helpful to have some basic foundation skills in music theory, keyboard mechanics, and signal flow/manipulation. So, again, it seems like you're on the right path, haha. But a lot of us started out haphazardly and have made it to the point we're at from every different angle. The most important thing is to find the balance between enjoyment and work ethic. I'm 12 years deep into production and I've learned over time that if I'm even kinda not feeling it, then I need to stop and try something else otherwise I'm going to get shoddy results. 

Do some studying now to get the basics, but write as much music as you can while you have a young mind for it. Even if it's crap, which it undoubtedly will be haha, you'll learn a lot from just going through the reps and finding for yourself what sounds good and what doesn't. 

Whenever you hit writer's block, that's your time to hit the books like a champ. Study your DAW and synth manuals, learn the ins-and-outs of compression and filtering, brush up on your music theory, etc. 

Once you get some basic mixing skills (basic understanding of leveling, EQ, compression, and delay/reverb), pick up Mike Senior's Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio and read that through a couple times.

"Here is Elon Musk's rationale explained:
&gt;Let’s look at it another way. Let’s imagine the Earth is a hard drive, and each species on Earth, including our own, is a Microsoft Excel document on the hard drive filled with trillions of rows of data. Using our shortened timescale, where 50 million years = one month, here’s what we know:

Right now, it’s August of 2015
The hard drive (i.e. the Earth) came into existence 7.5 years ago, in early 2008
A year ago, in August of 2014, the hard drive was loaded up with Excel documents (i.e. the origin of animals). Since then, new Excel docs have been continually created and others have developed an error message and stopped opening (i.e gone extinct).
Since August 2014, the hard drive has crashed five times—i.e. extinction events—in November 2014, in December 2014, in March 2015, April 2015, and July 2015. Each time the hard drive crashed, it rebooted a few hours later, but after rebooting, about 70% of the Excel docs were no longer there. Except the March 2015 crash, which erased 95% of the documents.
Now it’s mid-August 2015, and the homo sapiens Excel doc was created about two hours ago.
Now—if you owned a hard drive with an extraordinarily important Excel doc on it, and you knew that the hard drive pretty reliably tended to crash every month or two, with the last crash happening five weeks ago—what’s the very obvious thing you’d do?

You’d copy the document onto a second hard drive.

That’s why Elon Musk wants to put a million people on Mars.

"Try Tequatl the Sunless in Sparkfly Fen if you haven't already. Personally I find it not that difficult (I've done hills defense and zerg), it's just a matter of organization - but it's still a fun experience and a step up from the starting area world bosses like Shadow Behemoth, Svanir Shaman, and so on.

After that, the Triple Trouble Evolved Jungle Wurm in Bloodtide Coast is (by my understanding) the most challenging world boss in the game. And again, I believe (though I've never tried it) that it's mostly a matter of organization and knowing the mechanics.

I know everyone's hoping for instanced Challenging Group Content(TM) - and I am as well - but I'm hoping HoT also brings some new 'hardcore' world bosses as well as an overhaul of the old ones. Even a return to pre-nerf Tequatl would be nice."

The example was purely to show that it wouldn't matter whether or not you knew why the child was about to die, whether you could physically reach the child, whether or not your way of helping was less trivial than pressing a button, or even how many children there are that need help. If you can easily help someone who is suffering is there any morally relevant reason not to? 

It may be our intuition that our inactions are not morally relevant, but this is where Singer says our intuitions are wrong. In some ways that intuition is very obviously wrong. Is it wrong to let your own children starve when you are capable of providing food for them? Most people I think would agree that it is wrong; we have a moral obligation towards our children. Singer asks us why it should be different for children that aren't our own."

"Start with two Arduino Micros from a reputable seller. You'll want one to mess with while the other is running in production, and these little guys have enough pins on them to drive your project and more. Get two micro usb cables as well. Pick up a good digital multimeter, a spool of small electronic wire, a grab-bag of 1/8 watt resistors, some npn transistors, some diodes, some leds (for fun and learning), a solder less bread board, and a few SPST 5v shielded reed relays.

You can control the pump with the relay. Just cut the pump cord (near to the plug end, not the watery pump end) and splice the relay into the circuit (look this up online). You send a D/C signal to the relay which flips a completely isolated internal switch in the relay to make contact on the A/C circuit end.

I've heard that the moisture sensors don't work so well, but I have no experience with them. (Out of pure ignorance) I would suggest keeping the watering on a schedule instead of interfacing with a flaky feedback loop.

You can plug the Arduino into a server via the USB connection and pass serial data back and forth, sounds like you got that part down. I'd suggest taking a look at the Raspberry Pi if you don't already own a couple of them and seriously take a look at [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com).

Here's extra credit:

* Get some cheap photoresistors and measure light to make sure your cycles are running on time
* Stick a water level sensor on that barrel and report it over the internet
* Pick up a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor and add it to your setup
* Get a web cam and take time-lapse photos of your plants growing
* Stream the live video over the internet

I have some real-time Arduino libraries that can help you when you start to program:

This real-time [motor library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/Motor) gives you the timedOn() method, which could let your water the plants for a specific period of time.

Here's a real-time [light sensor library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/LightSensor) you can use to report the light percentage of your photoresistors.

I released this real-time [water level sensor library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/WaterSensor) today. All you need is an Arduino, a few resistors, a wire, and a piece of aluminum foil to accurately measure the water level of your barrel from the outside of the container.

You will see a bunch of example code that uses delay() on the internet, and this is fine to start but you should quickly jump to real-time. Read-up on how to manage your programs without delay(). People call it a state-machine but I think that word is scary, coming from someone who has pretty much mastered the concept. Once you get it; you can use this real-time [timer library](https://github.com/alextaujenis/Timer) to easily control program flow.

Good luck! Let us know about your progress!"

"It's not about car violence or gun violence, it's about the principle. I'm not sitting here saying we should ban people driving cars, but that's a lot more likely than banning guns, especially in the next 20 years. 

&gt;  People need to follow the rules of the road, learn to drive better, learn defensive driving, and learn that they don't own the road whereas guns are way more complicated.

How? If everyone who was a gun owner followed the rules than no one but criminals would be dead. But guess what, some people don't, but because we live in a free society we also need to accept that some people are going to abuse those freedoms. That doesn't mean *everyone* should be banned from using them, even if that's a majority of people want, it's called the tyranny of the majority. Believe it or not there was a time when people in the US thought it was A-OK to own slaves, or that interracial and gay marriage should be illegal, that doesn't make it *right*. 

Gun control seeks to infantilize and criminalize gun owners because gun control proponents think all gun owners are the same, just criminals waiting to happen. We aren't, and what the guy down the street does with his gun isn't my business just as much as what I do with mine isn't any of his. 

Just to bring it home, we already make it a crime to murder, assault, or otherwise harass someone, often with penalty enhancements if it's done with a deadly weapon. For as much as reddit moans and groans about how we criminalize everything and everyone and how common sense has abandoned the justice system in America, they're the same people who turn around and look at something that half the population engages in and say *yeah, they're criminals*.

"&gt; ok maybe that was a bad example

Well, it's illustrative of the relative nature of a discussion.  ""Bank Robbers are terrible, but banks are also terrible!"" does leave you asking the question, ""Who am I supposed to be rooting for?""

&gt; The difference is that with Safeway, if I don't like them, I can simply choose not to pay them.

But you can't choose not to eat.  So you'll be handing your money to someone.  By dint of convenience, it's very likely that this someone is a CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  Maybe it's the CEO of HEB or Walmart, instead, but that's cold comfort.

&gt; I can go to a local grocer, farm my own food, open my own store, or whatever.

Not in any practical sense.  My farmer's market is a 20 minute drive and operates six hours on one day a week.  Subsistence farming isn't a practical alternative to grocery shopping, particularly given how regularly I kill my house plants.  Opening a store is, again, totally impractical.  I don't know the first thing about retail grocery management.  And I'm still enriching a relatively elite band of food wholesalers, regardless.  Whatever isn't really an option, either.

&gt; If you are so buddy buddy with your local councilman, does that mean he won't do anything to you if you have a disagreement about how much his ""services"" are worth, and refuse to pay him.

I'm buddy-buddy with him, so if I have a dispute about my bill, I can sort out the discrepancy.  But if I was buddy-buddy with a Walton, that wouldn't mean I could grab food off the shelf of Walmart and flip the cashier the bird as I walked through without paying.  I'm not sure why paying for groceries is reasonable, while paying for residency is unreasonable."

&gt; RE ""investment pyramid collapse"" I assume you mean the value/btc going to nothing(or next to nothing) - isn't it odd wishing for people to lose money?

Investing in bitcoin is a zero-sum game; like investing in gold, but unlike investing in solid stock or productive businesses.  Whatever profit one can make in it comes from the pockets of later investors.  Actually, it is a negative-sum game, like lottery tickets -- because mining burns each day close to 1 million USD of new investors money, that is not going to come back to them.  

The main economic effect of bitcoin has been to transfer at least half a billion dollars, perhaps more, from some pockets to other pockets.  Like any pyramid, it has already ruined many people, and severely hurt many others, financially and emotionally.   Sooner or later it has to collapse, and then tens of thousands more, at least, will realize that the money they though that they had invested was just thrown away.  Its positive contribution, as a ""better"" means of payment, has been much smaller: it may have saved its users maybe 10 million dollars of bank fees, very optimistically.

&gt; If a friend of mine is sitting at a blackjack table and is up - I won't wish him anything but the best of luck. I wouldn't wish for him to lose his money.

Since the only way for him to make money is for someone else to lose it, I could not wish him good luck.  I would only wish that he gets out with the same money that he got in.  Unless he is playing against someone who deserves to lose money... ;D

&gt; If gold suddenly plummeted in value, what would your opinion on it be? (Positive, Angry, Neutral?). 

I would say meh.  Like any pyramid (or ""speculative asset"", if you wish) gold speculation merely will move (and has moved) tons of money from some pockets to other pockets, without creating any concrete wealth or rendering any productive service.  Mankind would be much better without GLD and its trading game."

"My beef with ""cultural appropriation"" is this:

Apparently, black people are the only ones allowed to wear dreadlocks. Where, though, do we draw the line at who is black and who isn't black enough? 1/8th? 1/16? By the logic of the people pushing this argument, there must be a point where someone is told they no longer have enough black in them and are no longer allowed to wear dreadlocks. This is telling people they aren't allowed to acknowledge or celebrate their own culture beyond a certain point.

To extend on this logic, if we then say that the above paragraph is ridiculous and that people are allowed to celebrate their heritage without limit, then we can trace every human being alive back to a sole point. This eliminates race and therefore renders cultural appropriation not applicable. 

TL;DR: The cultural appropriation argument is bogus and falls down on every level. "

The positive effects of free trade enjoy universal recognition among economists, though there are caveats (we should probably put more funding into worker retraining programs). All the same, the race to the bottom is a poorly constructed and emprically refuted myth. If you'd like I can post a literature review to this effect. Consensus is that trade creates lower prices and has a weakly positive effect on employment (think of cheaper intermediate goods boosting labor demand in importing sectors as one of several contributing factors) as well as a weakly positive effect on wages."

I went in bought my beer, got the guy a 750mL of 100 proof Rootbeer schapps, and stuck my change in the brown bag (5 bucks).  I went outside afterwards and gave it to the guy.

"While there's joy to be found in seeing a bigot slapped down in a karmic kind of way, the ""just desserts"" of the situation depends on the notion that divorce is a destroyer of the institution of marriage.

I disagree.  I believe that divorce is necessary to keep marriage positive and viable.  I believe that it actually *strengthens* my marriage to my wife that we both know we could end that relationship, and yet we choose not to do so.

Divorce is a vitally important right, especially for women.  People point to the rise in divorce numbers in the later part of the 20th century - well, a lot of those divorces cited spousal and/or child abuse as the cause.  That was going on before the 1950s as well, but women had little or no recourse; they just had to live through it.  I say emphatically that legal divorce is a vast improvement on that.

(I know it's not always wives who are being beaten by husbands, but let's not kid ourselves; that's how it is the vast majority of the time.)

Divorce is no fun.  It's painful and expensive and extremely difficult.  I have never gone through it but I have close family that has.  I am glad it was an option for all those I know who have gone through it, and I have seen what happens to couples who really should get divorced but who cannot do so, usually due to religious conviction.  They live in a nearly constant state of misery and frustration.  It doesn't have to be that way.

Divorce is like a backup parachute.  You hope you never have to use it, but when you need it, you REALLY need it."

"I understand what you're saying but I don't really recognize the points of your post mate. I'm an admirer of evolv since they're consistently accurate in a way few other chipsets are. Sure, there's some dislikes thrown around in ecr_eu but that's usually related to price, not the tech itself. There's also quite a bit of love for hcigar around here.

However, and I'm assuming you're meaning the HB40, I just haven't used the mod. The DNA-40 hit a weird spot when it was released. It was ""underpowered"" and the very first truly functional temperature limiting device.. and to be entirely honest it was just awkward. While people did adopt it many just didn't, even fewer went for the hcigar one.

Summa summarum; people just don't have it, so they don't talk about it."
"Like a fast breathing right? Everything else ducks down when the kicks hit, and they do it really fast and come back really fast too. The kick sound has a lot of overtones that kind of hit you in the chest so it could feel a bit like breathing. It's a great effect. You can hear it all over his work."

"ASOIAF is different. It doesn't has a main character. Technically, every character is a main character.

What I mean is several different perspectives of the same scene. You can't really know what Daenerys is doing if you are on Jon Snow's perspective.

"I'm not sure if this is the same type of freeze/crash that everyone else has been getting on Xbox One, but I just had a random freeze on the main menu, after turning on my Xbox and starting up the beta.

It was like a softlock, where the game did that repetitive noise type thing (And it sounded like a horn or something), my Xbox went back to the home menu, and then my console hard reset automatically a few seconds later.

I've gotten random freezes before where the game was just stuck on a black screen, or the main menu, but I was always able to just close the game from the home menu and restart it."
Honey is a highly underrated savory food condiment. It's probably my favorite thing to put on breaded/friend chicken and biscuits and I'll even use it with french fries and (I'm so sorry I'm about to say this) corn dogs. Do I have a honey problem? Probably. Yes.
"You also have to understand that it's pretty easy for him to work his way up through the pack comparatively with someone who isn't on that same tier of speed. So really so long as he starts close enough to be with the fastest top few he can actually race them and beat them. But if he goes out and pounds on the bike and stuff right on the edge of what he can do he's just putting more laps in with the risk of crashing and getting injured. Where he can put those laps in later when he has to already and still be right where he would have been. "

"When I started I was thinking a lot about using my keyboard better. One day I thought it would be really clever to have my secondary weapon binded on the 'E' key. I play a game, start as ct on D2.

"&gt; I think they did that purposely to try and show how ""Christianity and Islam aren't that different"", also they cherry picked the ""harshest"" or traditionalistic bible quotes while picking more liberal Qur'an ones.

"My first serving job was at a regional franchise, basically like a Perkins or whathaveyou. In retrospect this was the worst job I could have gotten, as I am a total misanthrope.

Anyways, almost every Saturday a group of parents and kids from a local gymnastics group would descend upon the restaurant like locusts. I won't use their real name, but it was something as obnoxious and cringeworthy as 'The Fantastic's'.

They'd never, ever call ahead to warn us that 40 or so people were coming. And they'd all order desserts, which was the most time consuming thing for a server at this place. And they wouldn't control their kids, and all their kids were fat, unpleasant little turds in leotards.

The worst part about it was that they'd always show up like 'we're heeeeere!' as if the staff was fucking looking forward to being graced with their presence."
"Make a roach warren every game in tvz. 3 ravager nukes will kill a liberator. Also they don't shoot spores, so have one at each base. Micro your queens with a lot of hold position so they dont stray into the death zone, and don't forget to have overlords around your min lines to spot the high grounds. Usually if they get a fast gas and open with marines, they're going libs, but scout it anyway.

After all this you're usually behind no matter what because libs are pretty good. but then just go mass roach and a VERY few ravagers (like 5 tops that stay in the back and pick off libs) and just kill him. With good roach micro liberators wont be able to kill your roaches before you wipe the floor with him. Once you learn how to deal with them lib allins aren't even good.

btw with econ changes it's not quite so bad to stay on 3 base for longer, so don't overextend if you don't know what the terran is doing."

"Well I've been really into ronda rouse lately. So much so that my girl got kinda pissed at me(jokingly on both sides).
After watching her fight bethe, I was really disappointed with her striking. A knockout isn't directly related to technical skill.

She IS fucking gorgeous though... and I do agree with 'dnb'. Fit girls are the most attractive."
"Clearly you never played anything competitive in you life if you think there isn't a such a thing as a ""winner"", but let me help you out.  There are different types of winners, but the basis is that they always find a way to be in the middle of it when the game needs something.  It could be some one like Jeter, who is always making a play, even though they have no reason to be were they are, or a guy like Scutaro who always seems to come up with a hit when its needed.  You have some one like Ray Lewis (when he isn't killing people) who beyond his play on the field, can make other people play above their regular level of ability.

I can see how you wouldn't understand, though, those two years of tee-ball don't really help you understand the deep parts that non athletes just don't comprehend.  I'm sorry you dad said "" fuck it, no more"" after watching you get set to right and just pick dandy lions all game.

As far as intimidation, if you think these players are in a bubble, were who they are facing doesn't matter, then you are as delusional.  These players aren't robots, they are people, just like you and me.  They know the guys that kill them every time and those they own.  They know if they are facing a batter that they should just walk instead of giving up another homerun.  Billy thinks the players don't matter, only the stats matter, but its bs, they are people, and the stats will fail you I'd you take out the human element.  Even the best hitters have bad days, go into slumps for no other reason than they are in their own head.  The stats didn't do it, they can't tell you why it happened, but there it is.

Keep thinking its just numbers though, dumass..."
"Because your genuinely curious il help you out. I felt the exact same way until I was in one. 

The thing is intellectually it doesn't seem like a huge issue but real life isn't black and white. Humans crave companionship, touching, skin to skin contact etc. and you don't get any of that long distance. You are no longer entwined in each other lives and thus have fewer real interesting topics to talk about or support each other on. Time zones can often be an issue and even across similar time zones people's lives can be vastly different and sometimes there are very few times during the day to actually talk. No matter how much you love or care for your SO there will be days where you can't connect on an emotional level where you might have in person and second thoughts will creep in. It's just the way we think, no matter who you are it can happen to you.

All this combined with human nature fighting against the thought of monogamy and things get complicated pretty quickly. It takes a pretty strong relationship to survive intact. At least if you're in person physical bonds can strengthen a relationship when it falters, when that goes away it becomes pretty damn hard."

It has been a long road and finally happy with the past 3 years seeing the development of the team as they make progress. Tavares is truly incredible and as the rest of the young talent around him continues to mature I think the Isles will be a contending team for years to come.
"My first thought was to answer celiac disease, because I spent a few years very confused by the severe symptoms I experienced from beer. I'm actually really grateful for it, because it stopped me from drinking for periods of time, even if the reasons weren't the greatest.

Seriously, though, I've been struggling with depression for the last year that's worse than any I've had before. I stopped drinking for the last time 6 months ago because I knew it was making the problem so much worse, but now... I'm honestly scared that I'm still SO depressed after getting sober again. Six years ago, quitting drinking launched me full manic speed out of my depression, and I still have the job that I got, and a lot of the friends that I've made. I would get down at times, but through relapses and sobriety, I always felt that I was depressed BECAUSE I drank, and stopping has always coincided with my depression lifting.

I didn't post a 6 month check in (and I was really looking forward to that!) because I spent the day crying in front of Netflix. I have weeks when I barely work 15 hours because I just can't stop crying enough to go in, or find the energy to get out of bed. I should be at work right now, but I slept until 2pm, had a massive sobbing shitshow thing over how bad I am at life, and now I'm watching BBC. I still feel exactly how I did a year ago, when I had just been broken up with by someone I love very much; being genuinely brokenhearted set off this crippling depression, but it's been over a year.

I think I'm scared because I've tried so hard to make a life that doesn't cultivate depression. I gave up alcohol, I changed out (most of) the junk food for fresh vegetable juice and other nutrient heavy stuff to help heal the damage, I'm sharing a house with friends and our animals instead of isolating myself. I'm *trying*. I'm at the point where an antidepressant is the only other thing I can think of, but I've only had bad experiences with them in the past and I don't have insurance. 

I know a lot of us struggle with depression, and I feel for every single one of you. You're not alone in that rut, and if you don't drink today, hopefully the rut gets a little shallower.

"**PUNCTUATION ADDED:**

Prison rape in US is more of a Hollywood thing.  It happens, but very rarely. There's a lot of consensual sex, but Hollywood makes out like it's on a check list: shoes, shirt, socks, rape. The way new prisons are constructed, there is nowhere to drag someone off to rape.

I was in for 4 years, probably weighed 120 pounds.  My last worry was rape. My worry was getting my ass kicked for looking at someone wrong, or my bunk mate eating my shit from the prison commissary, because he was a fat ass, or turning the channel on my little prison radio.

"I have a sequence of lines in a file that follow a pattern like CABBBBBABBCABBBB. An A followed by a number of Bs, with occasional Cs (where Cs are defined as anything other than A or B). I want to get rid of all the Cs and group the sequence into chunks like ((ABBBBBBB) (ABB) (ABBBB)) with one A and all the following Bs until the next A..

Here is my current code:

    (defn relevant-line [line]
      (or (A? line) (B? line))

    (defn extract-groups [lines]
      (let [counter (atom 0)]
        (partition-by

          lines)))

    (def grouped-lines (extract-groups (filter relevant-line (str/split-lines file))))

This solution works, but it feels horrible and I can't imagine it's idiomatic. What's a more Clojure-y way to write the code?

"&gt; This is surprising for me to hear, because I was fairly certain most of the men on this sub aspire to a soft harem situation, are against committing to a woman, and find women over 30 so undesirable that they never plan to LTR a woman because she will eventually age.

I think most TRP men have written off marriage (and to a lesser extent LTRs) because of the existential risk presented by divorce, pregnancy scares, and the like.  Between the high level of risk and the small percentage of women who would qualify as LTR+ material it's just not a realistic goal.  Why go unicorn hunting when that quest is almost guaranteed to be a waste of time?  

If a guy still wants to have sex, then, the next best solution is a soft harem/series of low-commitment relationships.  This isn't as difficult or risky as attempting to pull off an endless series of one-night stands and it opens the door for some level of relationship that isn't purely physical.  

Most men don't start out with that second goal; they settle on it because the preferred path is near impossible to safely walk.  "

here's my legit entry for #1 - 

 My initial instinct was Maid of Orelans, but that got taken.  I then remembered another song about Joan of Arc - [Maiden of Steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCnXO1ovNR8) by Thy Majestie

2) [Axel Rudi Pell performing in my opinion, the best version of Hallelujah yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKMP81DVLLk)

3) The lights go out, and [Sonata Arctica's 'Peacemaker'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtLJTP-GD_s) blares over the loudspeakers.  But instead of the sound of a gun cocking, a massive fireworks report shoots off, and the spotlight is put on the entrance ramp.  There stands **Viper** an ex Us-Air Force Pilot turned vigilante.  

4) This one...this was a tough choice.  Settled with [Dragonland - Shores of our Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pdfZNE-DF8) due to it opening and closing with the ocean/beach sounds.

5) Come, gather around children for a story about when Dragonforce was still considered underground...the days before Guitar Hero.  The days, of [Valley of the Damned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUWCrCXiVpA)

6) Being one of the old salts on the subreddit according to a lot of the other entries, I though I'd have a hard time finding a single good song.  I ended up having the opposite problem, and have settled on [Battle Hymn by Manowar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY13ikC46fE)

"I would get a work visa to work overseas in Ireland or Australia.  Alternatively I would try to find work teaching English in Southeast Asia.  You could also try working with the forest service.  I think that would be a good summer/fall job.  You could also just take a bookkeeping job.  You could volunteer with Americorps or with the Jesuit Peace Core.  You could try to sail commercially but I imagine that would only work if you have experience in that field.  Maybe try going to Alaska for some outdoor or tourism related work.   "

"IPS is much better as far as image quality, colors, and contrast, but the method to change colors (In-Plane-Swtiching aka IPS) is very slow in comparison to a ""quality"" tn/film.  But that is nothing new.  Historically there has always been a speed vs colors limitation going on, and something has to suffer for the other to be great.  


However, IPS panels can run at 120hz and beyond these days.  ASUS just released an amazing freesync 27"" IPS that will do 144hz, however, with freesync on, it is limited to 90.  So although it is partially crippled, it is great to see 144hz IPS finally on the market.  The total switching time is still double (4ms vs 2ms g2g) but in a real world gaming situation I doubt that would be noticeable.  There are also korean panels that have been on the market for quite some time that can do 120hz with their IPS panels.


For me personally, I used to totally ignore any TN/film monitor with shitty 6-bit color depth and cling on to my 60hz IPS for years.  But that changed when I got the asus VG248QE.  The color is almost just as good if I really convince myself, but the speed of the panel more than makes up for it. "

"Yep, it's very hard to come across handguns in the UK. Mandatory and lengthy Jail time for simple possession etc mean that no-one tries their luck.

And with no handguns and so few people willing to take the risk, it allows police resources to be focussed on people who actually try and import illegal firearms or manufacture them in the UK, all of which keep a lid on the illicit supply of firearms.

However, you can't paint the UK as an inpenetrable fortress. Guns and other contraband ARE brought into the UK. The Scale of drug use in the UK shows how easy it is to get illegal things into the country."

"Oh lawdy, threads like this are often a shitshow. Brace yourself.

I can tell you the opinion around here is generally ""don't fuck authors over - buy the books"". Especially when the authors get involved haha. Don't get me wrong though, the rest of the community is generally on that side of things too.

There really isn't *much* of an excuse to pirate ~~if you have an ereader~~ at all, actually, now I think about it. (That's what I get for redditing drunk...) For example, other than a few series I've been absolutely unable to not continue (generally Hobb's books haha) I've been able to survive quite happily only buying ebooks on sale and physical books from the Oxfam Books shop. Those are so cheap, there's really no excuse. I rarely buy a full-price book. In fact, I've been wanting to read The Lies of Locke Lamora for ages, and today I noticed it's only £1.99 on kindle so I got it :D Only like a year later than I wanted to buy it, but c'est la vie. When I am not stretched so ridiculously thin I shall be able to buy books at full price as much as I like :)

This argument is of course totally ignoring the ethical implications, which of course *most* people tend to already understand. Authors work bloody hard, and you (general ""you"", not you specifically) being financially stretched doesn't justify you taking their work for granted at not paying them their due. I didn't mention it at first because most people understand it's ethically wrong, but somehow believe that the lack of fairness in their life that lead to them being in a low income bracket justifies the piracy."
"According to [this](http://www.doublexscience.org/the-average-human-vagina/) article on vaginal size, the vagina can have diameters varying between 2.4 and 6.5 cm and the specs I found on your blackberry were 9.0424 cm wide.  I would say your theory is a bit of a stretch. "
"He is kind of implying an answer. Because there are more Muslims in Europe, problems will be more prominent. Therefore it seems like the European Muslims are not so well integrated. Additionally it could also be the case that parallel societies are more likely to exist when there are more immigrants of one kind."
"No the second amendment was added as a compromise between Federalists and anti Federalists to keep the states from being able to lock up all the guns in times that the militias are needed by the federal government to stop an invasion by the British or insurrections.  The US didn't originally have a standing army.  This whole idea that the founding fathers wanted us to use the guns against its own government is debunked by actual historic events. 

How did the Founders react when Americans took up arms -- not against the Redcoats -- but against their own government? That happened twice. In Shays' Rebellion in 1786, small farmers and shop owners in western Massachusetts, armed with muskets and angry that the courts were foreclosing on their property to satisfy their debts, forcibly closed the courts and threatened to march on Boston.

In the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, farmers in Pennsylvania and Kentucky took up muskets and threatened government officials who were charged with collecting taxes on whiskey.

These would be perfect examples to test out this theory of second amendment as a tool against tyranny but that's not what happened. 

Madison called Shays' Rebellion treason. The governor of Massachusetts raised an army to crush the rebellion -- an action endorsed by George Washington, Samuel Adams, John Jay, Benjamin Franklin and John Marshall.

Eight years later, during the Whiskey Rebellion, George Washington said that permitting citizens to take up arms against the government would bring an ""end to our Constitution and laws,"" and he personally led troops to extinguish the rebellion.

The Founders understood that if our Republic is to survive, the people had to understand that the government was now their government.

The militia the Founders envisioned was not an adversary of government but an instrument of government, organized by Congress and subject to governmental authority. It was not a tool for insurrection but, as the Constitution itself states, a tool to ""suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.""

"Well, there were some circumstances in those cases that made it difficult to target guerrillas that would be less of an issue in the US, namely:

* Extremely rugged terrain that Americans were unfamiliar with, that made it easy for fighters to hide from American attacks

* In the Middle East, religious/sectarian beliefs that made the fighters okay with maneuvers that caused a lot of civilian casualties that Americans attempted to avoid

* Drones now exist and are relatively effective at killing guerrillas in combination with ground troops 

* Most or many civilians weren't on board with the American cause, whereas there would likely be a massive portion of sympathy towards the government in a hypothetical American war given the extremely polarized American political climate

* Americans are used to a comparatively extremely high standard of living, which would likely make them less tolerant to getting involved in a war that sacrifices their comfort

* Both Vietnam and the Middle East (particularly the latter) were extremely politically unstable prior to the war, which paved the way for a high level of involvement

* The infrastructure of America is in large part controlled by the American government, which they could use to their advantage during a war 

If a militia attempted to overthrow the American government, unless America was destabilized in a number of ways, there would be very little civilian participation, and the government would have a massive home advantage."

"It could be overstepping our bounds as outside observers but it has been hinted at many times that Japanese video game directors who make a game that goes on to become a hit are fairly regularly railroaded into making sequels by their bosses. See particularly: Keita Takahashi, who wanted to do something completely different but ""had"" to make Katamari 2 (and 3?), and who eventually left Namco to pursue something different. See also: Tetsuya Nomura and KH (and FF7), Shinji Mikami and Resident Evil post 4, who left to make his own studio to make his own games.

There's a bunch of examples and they all had ways out, but the culture in Japan is different in ways its hard to get our heads around. I think as long as Kojima wanted to stay at Konami he basically had to make Metal Gear games because they were so successful."

- if I don't understand something, I ask the presenter to elaborate
- if I know any, I ask to compare the presenter to compare to an alternative
- I ask for an elaborated example
- I ask for the significance or practical relevance of the matter presented
- I ask for how they would go about doing further research

Therefore, if there's a lively discussion going on and I have nothing to add, I don't. On the other hand, if there's no discussion going on (any more), yet the session has not ended, I found that presenter and audience often appreciate if I ask one of my ""standard"" questions. You're far from the only one who does not (know how to) ask questions after a presentation. If you've got a room-full of them, that makes for some awkward half an hour…"

"&gt;In your opinion, do you think it's okay to argue against someone else's rights for the purpose of a ""greater good?"" 

As a rule of thumb, it is okay in the sense that it should not be forbidden by law. This does not mean I agree with the their arguments, and I can voice my opinion.

As a relevant example: I live in Finland, and we had a citizen initiative about legalizing same sex marriage and adoption. The parliament approved the law. Now those who oppose same sex marriage and adoption right have set up their own citizen initiative with the goal of overruling the already passed citizen initiative, restricting marriage and adoption only to heterosexual couples. I think they totally have the right to try and restrict these rights, but personally I completely disagree with their goal.

Likewise I think people totally have the right to present the arguments you said you have seen. I just personally disagree with them, as I see them inconsistent^1 and incorrect^2 .

1) Allowing same sex couples to marry does not prevent heterosexuals from having children; same sex couples [already have children](http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/harris-frozen/neil-patrick-harris-frozen-premiere-with-the-family-03.jpg) via adoption or sperm/egg donors and such already contribute to raising up next generations and if marriage is to protect families with children, these same sex families also deserve marriage; even now the requirement for marriage is not to have children, women who have passed menopause, sterile straight people and straight people with no interest in having children already can marry, so having or not having kids is irrelevant in respect of marriage rights.

2) [Research actually indicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting#Consensus) that same sex couples are as good parents as straight couples, and granting same sex couples marriage rights actually *improves* the conditions for children to grow up.


(But I'm not really interested in dwelling on same sex marriage issue right now.)

"That water based poly does not take a sanding well. I had the same thing happen to me on a tabletop. If you put a coat over that, the white 'residue' should go away. If you are having trouble getting an even coat of the poly, make sure you are using the right brush for it. I was using a white bristle brush and realized I should have been using a synthetic brush instead. Also, I wasn't putting a thick enough coat of the poly on because the application instructions said a light coat. But it ended up much better when the poly was milky white while applying. I used the varathane water based poly, but I'm not sure if it is the same one. Mine was the matte finish.

"Still an incredibly easy choice over Trump or *any* other Republican candidate in this election, whose positions are the absolute antithesis of Bernie's. There is a reason Bernie refuses to run as an independent--he, rightly, believes that the country is *far* better off and *far* closer to what he espouses with Hillary than it would be with *any* Republican candidate. And the positions of the candidates absolutely support this fact. That's why people who say ""I'll vote Republican over Hillary"" either don't actually support Bernie's ideas, are ignorant, or are stupid. And it's why this incessant smear campaign against Hillary is *really* going to backfire on us as a country if Bernie, god forbid, doesn't win the nomination. "

"Welcome dude. 

UK is a bit different. Joints have tobacco in them as you probably already know. It's strange to smoke one without tobacco, people aren't used to the taste and it's crazy expensive. Not many people actually use bongs, vapes, or edibles. Yeah from time to time people will make edibles but normally they're people who don't smoke much but have a fondness for baking, rather than full on stoners. There are always exceptions though obviously. 

UK stoner culture is less ubiquitous here. There's a lot less of an actual 'culture' in the UK. Lots of people will have smoked weed but rather few people will actually smoke weed on the regular, and those people are often the kind who are also partying pretty heavily with MDMA, ketamine, alcohol etc. so finding nice friendly stoners is actually kind of tough sometimes. Weed is generally less accepted here. We haven't really been able to do away with the negative stereotypes of dirty stoner types getting stoned all day. It's not widely recognised that all sorts of people smoke weed, and realistically there are far fewer professional stoner types than there are in the US, so it's associated with students and burnouts for the most part.

"&gt;why is it alright for only 7-12 people to decide that someone should be punished?

The jury doesn't decide who should be punished. Our lawmakers decide that when they attach certain penalties to certain crimes. The jury is only supposed to determine whether or not the defendant is guilty of the crime that they're charged with.

The only exception I can think of is capital punishment, in which the jury can be called upon to determine the extent to which a person is punished. However, note that in this situation, the jury isn't deciding whether the law should be set aside. They're determining whether or not the defendant has engaged in the behavior that the law says merits the death penalty. In other words, jurors in the penalty phase of the trial are still only determining whether and to what extent a law has been broken. They're not deciding whether or not to set the law aside."
"Except the prescriptions cannot legally be post dated. The date on the prescription had to be the date the doctor literally signed the piece of paper. 

They can, however, put a ""do not fill before"" date on it for the pharmacy, especially if they intend out to be a sequential prescription, but it's not necessary. 

(For example, the prescription was written June 1st, 2015 with a DNF before date of August 1st, 2015 because the doctor intended that to be the prescription for August.)

That way you can pick up the prescriptions for June, July, and August and then either hold onto them or have your pharmacy keep them on file. "

You are misusing the term ""posted"".  Those are **forecasts**, not what actually happened.

Flaherty responded that budgets normally include more downside risk than is realized, which is exactly what happened.  

Read the fiscal monitor, and look at past editions for the last fiscal year.  Those aren't budget forecasts, they are the actual numbers.  The trends for fiscal 2014/15 are clear: the government will post a surplus when they close the books next month.

I feel like I'm not properly visualizing this. This is a wall I ran into a year ago when I was playing with arduinos."
"Bodyweight benching is all fun and games, until you gain weight at the same rate you lift weight and your current lifts are a bit under your bodyweight. Everytime you think you just repped your bodyweight, you step on the scale and notice that you weight half a kilo more. Repeat next week."
"[This article](http://classroom.synonym.com/enough-courage-talk-girl-like-18334.html) is full of good advice.

"&gt; To be honest you got into 2 at fault accidents. This puts you in the very high risk category since now they assume it's only a matter of time before you cause a major accident

Yup. They're pricing the likelihood of expensive personal injury claims into his risk now."
"&gt;  It attempts to replicate the way humans ate for 1.99 million years before we developed agriculture, livestock

If you're replicating their eating, then you would be primarily hunter gatherer which eat fairly infrequently. If Paleo diet is replicating paleolithic man that would be the eating pattern of once every 2 or 3 days."
"&gt; bottom line we just need to get used to the fact that people are going to be gunned down randomly.

You've already decided all solutions are wrong from the start and declared that their lives don't matter, as long as you have a gun.  That's all that matters to you.  "
"I wrote this comment in another post, try this :

Same thing happened to me with my Up24 &amp; android, so I used my brother's iPhone to sync and it worked perfectly , then I reconnect my jawbone again with my android phone and it worked, still working with no problem."
"Hmmm. From what I can see, the drive bay that holds the optical drive probably can't be removed. Which means you have a couple of options;

1. See if there actually is a way to remove the bay itself

2. If there isn't, you'll have to cut a chunk out of the bay to get the RAM to fit.

3. Just remove the heatsink from the RAM stick, that way it will look exactly like your other stick. Naked, kinda. It doesn't affect performance in any way really, and is pretty simple to do if you look on youtube for tutorials."
"What I didn't agree with moses on the pansy thing was that we don't have the right to dislike her because of her voice.  What person in non-print media that has a bad voice can you think of?  I honestly can't think of any, not even on my local news channels is there someone I think, ""Wow, their voice is awful.  How'd they get that job?"".  I know it's far-fetched but there are only a couple of musical artists that have been popular that have poor voices.  Not counting rappers or most modern music because auto-tune has ruined people's expectations for singing talent.
  
That's my main quib with her and I don't like hype play-by-play casters.  The lack of in-depth knowledge is a slight issue but as he said doesn't make her bad at casting.  "
"I had someone order a full dinner then order another full dinner 2 hours later and I did not care. I stopped thinking about stuff like that after a week, a lot of people do weird shit like that.

The people I judged are the ones that deconstructed our most expensive pizzas into something cheap like a pepperoni or ham and pineapple (which still happens *a lot*), even after trying to explain to them that they don't have to order a specialty they can build their own."
"This is a good time to remind everyone of the ""0 byte"" bug where the game overwrites your save with a ""0 byte"" file. After that the game will not launch. There is no way to recover your vault. The only thing you can do is move the file out and restore from backup. You lose all purchases.

**TO AVOID: YOU NEED TO BACKUP YOUR VAULT EVERY DAY AND AFTER EVERY PURCHASE.**"
"You'll get a 4th card at the start of your first turn.

You'll get a 5th card at the start of turn 2, which was the earliest you could have played Wild Growth anyway if you went first.

If neither of those is Wild Growth, Innervate, or a 2-drop minion, you can hero power.

Turn 3 you'll have another card. If still nothing playable, Wrath the minion they played. If you are lucky, they'll have a 1 hp minion or divine shield on board and you can cycle.

Turn 4 you'll have another card. You've now drawn at least 10 of the 30 cards in your deck. 

At that point, if you don't have a playable card, you were massively unlucky or have a bad deck. 

...

So if you have a horrendous hand in ""most of your games""... build your deck differently, or mulligan differently."
"That was one tidbit that bothered me after the prequels came about. She says that Kenobi served her father in the war, but her father was *only* a senator. Unless, of course, she implies that the galactic military was collectively serving the Senate. And now that I typed that out, I realize that's probably what she meant. Problem solved, guys!"
"&gt;Judge Janice Rogers Brown said it was possible the government would refuse to provide information about the secret program that could help the challengers pursue their case. In a separate opinion, Judge Stephen Williams said the challengers would need to show they actually were targeted by the surveillance program.

&gt;Judge David Sentelle dissented in part, saying he would have thrown the case out entirely because the plaintiffs offered no proof they were ever harmed.

Wut? Are you kidding me? That's some serious bias and jump to conclusions. It's like the 4th amendment doesn't mean shit. Privacy rights don't mean shit. You don't mean shit to these people. Fuck them.

Serious blow to privacy rights and civil liberties today. How depressing."
"What they ought to do, I think, is what they are supposedly going to do for planes -  make an international tree and add the non-paper Japanese tanks there along with those from countries that were more minor participants in WW2 or cannot fill up a whole tank tree on their own.  I don't know why it would have to be that because Japan has a plane tree of their own, they have to have an entire tank tree too if its impractical to do so.  "
"My promoted goalkeeper can apparently play as a LB.. and he is 6'6 or 6'7 (200 cm). He also went from 16 y/old to 56 in half a season and is now ""a player for the retirement books""

They haven't broken my water thankfully they are aware its risky if you don't progress. Although this whole process has been stressful my ob and nurses have been super informative and given me all options along the way
"At best they're inexperienced and overworked with 16 PC's. For gods' sake, a Ranger's whole niche is wilderness survival. It has been for awhile. It's practically synonymous with the name. Even if they didn't know exactly what Rangers were capable of, I would think given the nature of the campaign they had built, they would check once they discovered they had not 1 but 2 Ranger players. And if they did, they didn't bother to fill in their players on the consequences of that choice and they didn't bother to try and compensate them for any changes."
"I'd recommend picking up some faster RAM such as [this](http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-HyperX-FURY-2x4GB-1866MHz/dp/B00J8E90I2/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440797633&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=RAM+1866)

Also if your budget can stretch then pickup an SSD to use as a boot drive.  "
"I'd like a 1cc Merfolk that replaces Cursecatcher and protects the more important dudes.

Something like a 1/1 for 1 with Sacrifice ~: Target creatures gains protection from the color of your choice until end of turn. 

But since protection seems to be frowned upon lately, and also isn't really a blue ability, I'd do with hexproof."
"21.5 per 100k to be precise, there are 6 cities that have higher rate. That's for starters.

In my dictionary neither 6 nor 10 is ""tons"". That's what I was commenting.

Comparing cities vs national average is plain stupid. If you want to compare TOP then there are 10 cities in Mexico that are in top 50 in the world and only 4 in the US. You should either compare similar environments (tourist areas?) or averages/medians , not top city averages vs national average."
"Basically, to remove any ambiguity, I used the dialect groups given by Wikipedia for the [Romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages) and [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages) languages, although now that I've looked at that page again it seems I've forgotten to distinguish Norwegian from Danish/Swedish. 

In fact, it's not actually that hard to distinguish Sicilian from Southern Italian (ie Neapolitan); the hard bit is actually distinguishing Neapolitan from Central Italian. But Neapolitan is supposed to be more closely related to Sicilian than to Central Italian, hence why I'm a little stuck."

"Usually you can't tell you've had medicine at all. I once did a study for a concentration improving drug. Since then, I can now read and walk at the same time, lol. Probably could before but never tried.

"Hockey. With the success of the Hawks its popularity went through the roof here. Most people still don't quite get it here, and that's ok. Before that there were small groups of hockey players here and there.  It's a beautiful game and everyone should try to understand it, not just watch it."
"Thanks mate. I'll be pulling the trigger on some tickets this weekend or early next week then. And yeah I think I'm a real fan, albeit from half way around the world, and I have a feeling things are turning around. No more Longley, Hardaway, McDyess, Francis, Curry, Injured Tmac, Jerome James, and all those bad dreams of the last 15 years. I think the Knicks are going to get back to being special, and I can't wait. :)"
"If you're going to keep your head in the clouds why not write sci-fi and get paid for it?  Full on acceptance back then would have resulted in mass death.  My uncle who was in Nam tells me of fragging stories and he was only one military generation ahead of me.  You can't just have an idea in your head and make it so especially when it comes to the military.  We expect these men to literally take a bullet in the head for their beliefs.  You can't just go around mixing that up.  Change is slow. "
"&gt;Literally no one has EVER said that.

Don't go back on your previous statements. Due to the subreddit rules, I'm not allowed to link to comments.

"Survival of the fittest. We're helping to push evolution along to more intelligent species. All the retarded wildlife can get caught up in this stupid shit, and maybe the smart ones will avoid it, make babies, and contribute a few IQ points gained in the animal world.

You think the major asteroid collision was easy for Earth life 65 mya? No. But it wiped out dinosaurs to pave the way for humans. One day Earth will no longer be habitable, and 99.9% of life's only hope is to have humans repopulate Earth species to other planets out there. We're really their only hope in the grand scheme of things looking out billions of years into the future. Hopefully you readers can think about things in the really long term, instead of the short term."
"I have a theory about the whole RTD era:  it's all about normal people reacting fairly reasonably to utterly ridiculous and impossible scenarios.

The arc of Rose is basically an attempt at seriously answering the question ""what if an average girl from a council estate started traveling with a mysterious time-traveling alien?"" in great detail.  As you see with Mickey and Jackie, what happens to the people around this phenomenon is typically something like, ""they accept it and get on with life.""  In fact, we see Jackie doing this in Love and Monsters - despite the fantastical situation she and Rose are in, she still has to go to the laundromat to wash her clothes because the washer's broken.

So when Ursula is turned into a paving stone, she and Elton deal with it in a pretty reasonable way.  I'm sure there was a long period of adjustment, but we don't have to see it - Elton and Ursula have, by this point, built a life together that more or less functions in spite of their bizarre circumstances.  Is the blowjob joke a bit stupid?  Yes, but this is the same writer who came up with the Slitheen.  But I can't really see an argument where it's actively offensive.  RTD does a pretty passable job at showing, in just 2 minutes, how a human/pavingstone relationship would work day-to-day, ending in Elton's truly beautiful soliloquy that, to me, is one of the highlights of all Doctor Who:

&gt;When you're a kid, they tell you it's all... grow up. Get a job. Get married. Get a house. Have a kid, and that's it. But the truth is, the world is so much stranger than that. It's so much darker. And so much madder. And so much better."
"Yep. Whenever I ask people for examples of this, it's always either a student union president from some small college on the other side of the country, or an anecdote that sounds like something an elderly relative would post on Facebook. But somehow that's this huge army of people that are taking over. 
 "
Yes. If you have to serve jail time of more than three days during proceedings against you and you are found innocent then you should be paid damages and the accuser should be punished if the intent is malicious.
"Not exactly, but if you use *!go* for example, only results from google will be shown. I have configured my firefox to search with google if I type ""g &lt;search term&gt;"" for the times I really need google."

"Regular call up, yes.

What was the immigration policy back then? When they showed up in Plymouth was there a Wampanoag Indian checking paperwork and making sure everyone had proper vaccinations? He obviously wasn't very good at his job. Was there a long wait to immigrate to the New World?
"There's a vast difference between having a medical record that can be exchanged between hospitals and a unified file system giving access to these informations everywhere and/or to everyone. That's not difficult to understand. One day will come where every informations about you will be accessible to anyone willing to pay : location, health, sex reccurence, poop cycles, EVERYTHING. Simply because you think giving informations is an act free of malice.

Well, it isn't and I said, you should be aware of the risks. "
"California.

Bail bond forfeitures may go through either the DA or the County Counsel - it is up for the county to decide.  The last two counties I've been working in both had the county counsel handling their bail bond forfeitures.

Asset forfeiture related to criminal matters (e.g. proceeds of drug sales) go through the DA.

Other civil forfeitures (e.g. towed cars that were never claimed,  licensing bonds posted with the city, etc.) go to the city attorney."
"Says the clearly unbiased person with ""cats"" in their username.

Also, to suggest that this woman get a divorce with her husband over a disagreement about a dog is absolutely mind-blowing. I just started reading this sub and it's far too common for people here to suggest ""leaving"" or divorcing as the first and only solution to any dispute, it's ridiculous."
"Exactly like /u/PrecisionEsports said. No doubt there were tons of people who wanted it taken down, but the shooting is what sparked the politicians into action. And let's be real, if the decision to take down the flag hadn't had the massacre behind it, the closet racists would only be louder. Most likely a lot of it would have even spilled over into Reddit as ""political correctness gone crazy!"""

"Actually, I was just sticking up for my younger brother.  You decided to make an issue out something that obviously has nothing to do with you.  Not sure why but that's what you did.

"No, profit motive does not mean people would profit. Profit motive describes a corporation's duties to that of only profit. In a corporate business model, with investors and the like, profit is put above all else. This is a bad thing for certain sectors, such as healthcare and incarceration. "
"I posted something like this months ago when he was responding to questions about it. It's sad how he will let the integrity of the game be destroyed because some people may cancel their memberships if they take it out. He's basically letting people who don't play the game run the game which is fucking sad. I had high hopes for OSRS when it came out but anything run by Jagex is ruined in the end anyways. Just waiting for the game to die in the next few years so something like 2006Scape can come out again, which will be free."
"I am well aware of that, but it still doesn't help your case in this instance.

I mean, if I created an account called Neiths_Giant_Boobs and posted some low-effort screenshots of Neith where her tits just happened to be in the middle of the frame, could you see why they'd get removed right? Not only is it low-quality content (also against the rules of /r/smite), but the username combined with the content makes it easy to justify removing it, y'know?"
"&gt; I mean Jase and Kaysar were both evicted fifth in their seasons and were in all stars?

Um because All Stars was done after ONLY 5 SEASONS to pick from. They should have waited longer to do it. They were forced to bring back personalities. Half of that cast sucked as players. 

All Stars 2 has *17 seasons* to pick from if they do it next year. They're not gonna waste the players they chose on dumb characters if they want it to actually be an ALL STARS.

Being All Star should mean you played one of the best games. You should be in the top tier of BB players of you're an All Star."

"I say hunter. 

I was lured into playing WoW by a guy friend of mine once he explained to me I could have a pet, change my hairstyles AND be an adorable blood elf. :)  (I had only played Ultima Online, and the characters were 2 dimensional and not cute at all, so this was exciting for me). 

I really liked having my pet to get attacked instead of me, and being able to feign death if I was out questing and needed to go AFK. 

Now that I've been playing for 6 years I still prefer my hunter to my other characters. Everything just seems so much easier on a hunter, and once she gets to raiding she'll have some fun special responsibilities (little things, like misdirecting adds that can't be taunted, etc, but it's the little details that make some boring fights tolerable).

"&gt; That extremely oversimplifies the problem. France restricts guns. America doesn't restrict guns. Suicide rates are the same. Therefore, guns don't have any correlation to suicide rates. You could make a statement like this, and alarm bells should be going off in the head of any scientist or statistician.

The correlation follows more than just one example. The fact is gun laws have not stopped other first worlders from killing themselves.

&gt;Do you think suicide might have other factors than guns that might need to be controlled? That people could commit suicide for more reasons than ""hey, look there's a gun lying around!?""

Yeah that's my point.

&gt;The reality is, and hopefully we can both agree, is that guns aren't the #1 driver in crime in any direction. More guns don't cause less crime, good policing does along with a myriad of other factors, which is in large part why we saw such dramatic drop in crime rates since the 90's. 

Ok we agree here.

&gt; America already some of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world while also having the largest prison population. If guns were supposed to stop all these crimes from happening, it doesn't look like it's worked.

You are arguing a strawman here, I don't believe more guns cause less crime. I believe it has no effect at all either way.

"Muslims certainly did forcibly convert people in the areas they conquered.  These people did not convert out of spite of ""Christian Roman oppression"" because by that time they had been citizens of the Roman Empire for over a thousand years and have been Christian for hundreds of years. 

Islam spread through conquest mostly as the Muslims would conquer regions then oppress non-muslims until they converted. A process which took hundreds of years. 

I'm not calling for mass genocide or religious war. Those are words you're putting in my mouth to make your argument sound better. The allies didn't commit genocide or religious wars in WWII.

How could we when we would just be continuously bombing them with air superiority until they submitted? "
"Basically, an animation cel is a clear acetate sheet, that animators paint a part of a sequence of an anime. Each sequence consists of many cels. Let's say this cel is A1. That means it is the first cel of a sequence, And the A means it is the bottom layer of a grouping of a cel image. Usually in Dragonball, we see Ki and rocks and stuff that is moving on the screen. A B or C layer would be these effects, or even another character in the panel. These are then placed on a watercolor background, and photographed, and made into slides, which when put into sequence, create the anime we see on TV. Each cel is one of a kind."

"&gt;you realize that it's actually incredibly easy to become a teacher. 

That's true, it is easy to **become** a teacher.  Anyone college educated who decides at this moment to become a teacher could be in the classroom within the month, perhaps.  The **process** is simple, and requires very little beyond a B.A.  But why judge a career on the difficulty of the entry process?

Are the low standards an indication of the skill required or salary deserved?  Or are they an indication of the low supply * of teachers?

\* *You seem to think that there is an overabundance of teachers, keeping salaries low.  I disagree: there is always a need for more teachers as the turnover rate is high.  Especially in a district like OUSD.  Consider that the salaries are lowest in the districts with high turnover rates-- i.e. low supply of teachers.  This could indicate that a high supply of teachers does not drive salaries down, as you had proposed.*

If the supply of workers in another job is low, a firm might raise its salaries, hoping to attract talent.  School districts cannot raise salaries easily, so they need to attract more workers by lowering standards."

"He's talking about the R2Y2**V3**. That's completely made up. V3 never had any blue prints or anything about it. It's Gaijin's brain child. 

The R2Y1 was created. Most people know that here. The R2Y2 Version 1 (the one we have in game) is the same thing but with two of the Kikka's engines trapped on the wings. Fair enough, there's some information to be given there. We know how the Kikka's engines preformed, and we know how the R2Y1 flew. The plane was being built, like you said. We know how it works, and it's fine to my standards. 

The R2Y2 Version 2, was a proposed design. It was to have the same engines but instead of on the wing, to move the fuel tanks to the inner wings, and have the engines in the back. This is definitely a paper plane, but enough that we know 85% how it would fly and work. There's enough information.

"&gt; The argument is that no one that has a concealed weapon will attack someone and get into a fist fight with them.

Again, you are assuming that it started as a fist fight. It's also entirely possible that Zimmerman had his gun out prior to the physical confrontation in an effort to intimidate Martin, and Martin attacked him because he thought Zimmerman was going to shoot him.

Again, I will point out that Zimmerman has twice been arrested for threatening behavior involving a firearm since the incident with Martin.

&gt;&gt; and walk back towards Zimmerman.

&gt; Thats fine. If that was all he did. 

Ah, so then you admit in your original response when you said, ""[It was proven Martin doubled back to confront Zimmerman. He could have kept walking home but he didn't.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3iq0c3/gunman_in_onair_deaths_remembered_as_professional/cuizbcw)"" that Martin was completely within his rights to do that.

Martin: He could've turned around but didn't.             
Zimmerman: Doesn't matter it was his legal right.

You have an extreme double standard for these two individuals, and I hope that at least you an recognize it.

&gt; Not a single thing made about his ""character"".

Except of course your entire argument that Zimmerman wouldn't have instigated the fight. That is based entirely on his character.

&gt; He could be the biggest douche in history but it doesnt matter. 

It would certainly matter if he was a douche who repeatedly demonstrated a predisposition to getting into violent altercations involving firearms. I'm sure that you also argued that any mention of Martin's being suspended from school for fighting are also immaterial to the case.

&gt; Everything we know adds up to an aggressive Travyon that assaulted someone. 

Or an overzealous Zimmerman who threatened someone with a gun, and that person defended themself.

The fact is that there is no _proof_ of which one started it. There is evidence which can be interpreted in several difference ways. Your continued obstinate rejection of that simple fact doesn't add credence to your position, and just highlights the vastly different criteria for reasonable doubt that you have for the two individuals."
"I think you hit the nail on the head.  This is a city very close to where the anti - gay bakers were located.  Things aren't perfect, but if blatant LGBT discrimination starts to hit the front pages people in Portland don't fuck around.  This school was going to face a daily shitshow."
"I'd prefer the game to be F2P with a sub (Daybreak All Access) giving decent perks.

A cash shop can pull in a ton of money with cosmetics, fluff items (pets/mounts/fireworks), and of course player housing. Since they have Player Studio, they also have a huge way to allow players to create and profit from what they come up with as well, be it gear skins/cosmetics or building related stuff (textures, doors, chairs, roof designs).

No matter the system in place, people will attempt to make a profit through less than ""legal"" means, but if DB provides a way for fans to keep their cash in-house, all the better.

Personally don't have experience with Warframe, but I would rather not see actual gear with stats or whatever sold in the store. While I don't care if joe gamer bought something that took me a month to earn, I know that many feel cheated when it is an option.

Paywalls and P2P would seriously hurt EQN most likely. Best option is to go B2P for a short while or just straight F2P and have a ton of dev/player made stuff for sale that adds to the experience but doesn't become needed/mandatory to actually enjoy the game."

I didn't delete anything. Talk to the mods if anything is deleted. And like I said, link to the comments they replied to and tell me if me linking the same source to them was inappropriate. You have a nasty disgusting habit of keep trying to take things out of context. That's pretty much a given because you have an indefensible bias and you are just trying to use trollling tactics to derail and distort information. Full context and transparency doesn't work in your favor.

You haven't made a single valid case for why any part of the comment you labeled as racist was racist. You haven't made a single valid case and in fact made a case contradicting your claim that the second comment you quoted was a personal attack on the grounds that calling someone JIDF was equivalent to calling them a ""Jew shill""

Before you come back with another stupid accusation, let me preemptively repeat myself:

Israel is a country. Criticizing its human atrocities and other disgusting evil actions is not racist. And yes, fuck that country, it's illegally occupying land and killing innocent people. Fuck people that defend those actions. And fuck morons who keep trying to hide behind the racism shield when we're talking about a multiracial multicultural and multi-religious COUNTRY. Fuck Israel and their organized social media propaganda, this is why the WORLD hates it.

Fuck Israel."

"It certainly is interesting.

Interesting that it's not OK to take someone else's video publish it on social media and make money off of it but linking to someone else's article and making money off of your account is fine. Strange that photos and videos (things that display natively) aren't OK but linking to things are.

The problem is too little or too much enforcement. For instance, on YouTube if you claim someone else has posted your video, suddenly they are no longer able to monetize it and you get all the profits. Here's the issue....

I posted a video. Some years later a company claims it's theirs. Instantly and without need to provide any proof, YouTube gives them the monetization on my video. It takes seconds for them to claim a video.  I now had 2 choices: let them have it or file a counter claim which takes a good bit to fill out and I must provide proof (there is zero burden on them to provide such proof at first). So I show that the video is from 2007 where their company didn't exist until 2011 and there is no way it's their video. YouTube gives me control of the video again but I lose all the monetization during that time. There is no punishment for them filing a false claim. I look into it and it turns out this company does this with thousands of videos.

So as you can see, the system works in both ways. While some like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter need to make it easier to find your content and claim it, others make it too easy (though as required by DMCA) to claim anyones content as your own and reap the rewards.

Facebook solution sounds good. It should allow me to upload all of my content and it will then check to see if others are using that content. I shouldn't have to patrol all of social media looking for those violating my copyright and profiting from it. The system should automatically do so. 

We also need stronger punishment for those that violate. A 3 strikes and you're out policy. Make there be consequences for violating. Spend all that time building a huge social channel and now you stole others work? You lose that huge following you built."

"&gt; var Foo = {
  C: 3
};
 
&gt; var bar = Object.create(Foo);
 
&gt; bar.A = 1;
bar.B = 2;

&gt; Look at how drastically simpler this is

Here's the thing, though: The way you initialize a newly created Foo object (`bar.A = 1; bar.B = 2;`) will be copy-pasted *everywhere* that you create a Foo. That's bad. Let's fix that by putting an `initialize` method in Foo.

    var Foo = {
      C: 3,

      initialize: function () {
        this.A = 1;
        this.B = 2;
      }
    };
     
    var bar = Object.create(Foo);
    bar.initialize();

And here's the next thing: We will *always* want to make sure newly created Foo objects are initialized, so let's combine creation and initialization into a single step.

    var Foo = {
      C: 3,

      initialize: function () {
        this.A = 1;
        this.B = 2;
      },

      createAndInitialize: function () {
        var instance = Object.create(this);
        instance.initialize.apply(this, arguments);

        return instance;
      }
    };
     
    var bar = Foo.createAndInitialize();

These are both good things. Yet, in case anyone hasn't realized, we just re-created constructors and the `new` keyword. It actually would have been a whole lot easier if we just used the built-in language constructs."

"Backstabbing is a lot more viable with the 2.0 mechanics changes allowing individual characters to go into stealth.  I haven't yet built a full-stealth Rogue designed around backstabbing, but it seems like a fun option, opening up the possibility of taking out a high-priority target before combat really begins.  Other people's descriptions of how to use Backstab here are spot on.

More important than Backstabbing (and this hasn't changed in the last few months) is getting Sneak Attacks.  Sneak Attacking is a passive ability that all Rogues from have level 1 onward which gives your Rogue +50% damage (!) while attacking a target with certain status effects (status effects are debuffs that your characters apply to the target).  These debuffs are Blinded, Flanked, Hobbled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Prone, Stuck, Stunned, and Weakened.

These status effects are in general very easy to apply.  ""Prone"" can be applied by using your Fighter's Knockdown ability.  ""Flanked"" can be achieved simply by placing your rogue in the area directly behind the target you're attacking.  You can read the spell and ability descriptions to see which status effects a spell or ability will apply.  I find that using a Cipher's ""Mental Binding"" (a level 2 Cipher power) is incredibly helpful when used in combination with a Rogue.  Not only is it an *amazing* crowd control ability which applies ""Paralyze"" on the target it's cast on (and also applies ""Stuck"" on everything in a large AoE around it), it will enable your Rogue to get Sneak Attacks on everything it touches for the spell's duration (usually about 10 seconds).

Get used to using your other characters to apply Sneak Attack-granting status effects religiously on every target he attacks and I guarantee you your rogue will be a DPS machine that will lead the party's ""most damage done"" by a wide margin!"

"I stood on the platform watching my target closely. I'd always told my friends that I'd kill for a life free from the rat race. 

Of course, back then the words didn't carry as much weight as they did right now. Back then it was just an empty, theatrical phrase meant to convey my desperation and frustration in a light-hearted way that didn't make people too uncomfortable. 

Things had changed. Things were so much more desperate... so much more real. 

I tried to keep my gaze inconspicuous. I didn't want to lose focus on the task ahead of me, but I didn't want to alert anyone either.  

Not that anyone was paying attention. I looked around at the robotic, expressionless patrons crowding the platform.  They were too caught up in the motions of their own shitty rat race to give a fuck about what I was doing.

I looked down at my watch. 2 minutes. My heart was racing. I had made my choice, but I couldn't help but wonder if I would go through with it.

I closed my eyes and imagined a life free from stress. No more wondering about how I was gonna pay the rent. No more trips to the shady check cashing stores begging for loans that just buried me further. No more battling that damn bottle.

I couldn't wait. I deserved this. 

The speakers chimed and announced a passing train, breaking me from my thoughts. It was time.

I watched the train closely. Not yet. Wait... wait.... I darted into motion and dove forward off of the platform. "

"My point is that Scandinavian-style social welfare doesn't work without at least some degree of government control over national resources, and trying to do so is not politically feasible and would be a minority position even among Democrats.

If you are arguing that the US social system is doing a good job at hedging against a recession, I presume you haven't been following the Federal deficit. Increasing spending on that system wouldn't exactly help with that.

In any case, thinking that you can finance anything by taxing ""the rich"" is an illusion. Tax revenue must come from all of society to be a viable and sustainable source of income."

I don't think I'm alone when I say that I sometimes get SRs and have no clue whether they're worth leveling. It would also be a great tool to 'plan ahead'. As in, find out what cards would really improve your team. And unless you were blessed with many natural SSRs, z-awakened SRs will play a huge part in most of your teams.

I realize it will be a lot of work to gather all the required data, but it doesn't have to be finished overnight.

"I think you might be off-base on the economy.  Look at some of the major religions in the world, and where they think the money should go.

I think a theocracy looks a lot more like the old Soviet Union.  There would be a Central Committee of members of a privileged class, and a secret police to make sure the proles stayed in line.  The vast majority of the output of the workforce would go directly to the privileged class.

Does that mean if you lived in Mississippi, you could own slaves until a few years ago? Of course not.

Where'd you find a 120hz IPS panel though? I know they exist but usually there's a rather large amount of ghosting and artifacting. 

However in the realm of 1440p and above you're getting to resolutions that CRTs never did. So I'm willing to take the hardly noticeable (at least to me) degradation in color for more workspace and resolution. 

I get it, CRTs did some things better, but monitors are catching up. I'd like to get my hands on a 4k screen, but I haven't had the chance. I hear the resolution really makes the colors a lot nicer. Also 10bit depth helps.

"Heh.  My mother was like this, too.  Men were nothing but promiscuous sexist assholes.  They never wanted anything but sex.  They'd even come home drunk at midnight demanding sex.  Men were impulsive, disloyal, and incapable of understanding how their actions impacted others.  Violent, too!  Male socialization was all testosterone-poisoned swaggering that could go wrong at any moment.  Oh, and her opinion on sex itself!  I didn't have to ask for it in order to learn that it was a filthy and awful thing.  The world would be better off if nobody wanted it, and of course only men ever did.  Men!  Good for nothing but children and labor... and not to be trusted around children, either.

I feel I should point out that her first husband divorced her for infidelity.  Her second husband divorced her for infidelity.  Her third husband slugged her and then moved them both out into the countryside so bringing handsome young friends to visit would take some actual effort.  As far as I know, it was the only time she'd ever been hit by a romantic partner, and to my knowledge it never happened again.

Somehow, and I can only blame the stupidity of childhood, it took me *years* to notice she ranted about others doing things that I didn't see anyone doing except her.  One of the 'click' moments being one of the nights she came home drunk.  I overheard what she said to my stepfather, and that is all I will say about that.  My mother's complaints about the world sounded like complaints about herself cast upon 'men'.  If I met someone like her today I would risk cracking my social circles to get away.

I wish she'd felt less shame about her libido and more shame about her misandry."

Thankfully some people realize there's a different between demanding someone to lose weight and encouraging them to. I enjoy hearing how people feel on the subject, though. Regardless of if we agree or not. "

"&gt;Sure, but that's one example. I gave another example in which a woman obviously isn't going to have a good chance at doing better than her H. So it's not all women- it's just women who are equal in attractivness to their husbands.

I agree it's not all women. but the question is is she staying together because she *can't* get anyone higher or genuinely content with what she got.

There are some RPers who advise marrying/LTRing a woman lower than you. Unfortunately, these women can be just as entitled and not fully appreciate her situation of bagging a high value man for herself, relative to her own value. She should be thanking the heavens everyday but still has entitlement.

Here are some testimonies from guys who married/LTRed women lower than them:


* [No you can't marry an ugly girl and expect her to be faithful. AWALT. No exceptions, even for uggos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/37mjxy/no_you_cant_marry_an_ugly_girl_and_expect_her_to/)

* [Anyone ever LTR'd/married a woman that had a lower SMV than you because you wanted to avoid the bullshit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/342nwe/anyone_ever_ltrdmarried_a_woman_that_had_a_lower/)


&gt;Yes, but if all women are de facto ugly after..idk, 24, then even being able to score a good looking guy for commitment, even if he isn't rich or famous, sounds like a pretty huge win to me.

Depends on her routines for skin/body/looks.

It is a ""huge win"" to do that, but will they be thanking their heavens for landing this guy?

Personally, I'll take my chances with the better looking woman and her hypergamy."
"Swains combo is up every 9 seconds (well, not his W but that's honestly optional), he heals in every trade, and he does tons of damage. You can W them when you see a creep is about to die, and go ham. The only problem is his fairly short range and his mana situation without blue buff. "
"Recent LSU Grad here. Man I love this guy. It's crazy, LSU fans were trying to rationalize him not going in the draft because he was to undersized to play OLB, and here he is playing MLB now. I think we just hoped he would come back and form a great linebacker group with Beckwith.

However, the guy is great. He was probably one of the most consistent defensive players for LSU the past couple of years. It sucks to see him play to a division rival, but he has a lot of potential. Should be great in pass coverage too."
"&gt; She also always used to give me selection boxes at Christmas time wrapped in the oldest Christmas wrapping paper that I had ever seen. 

Basically everyones granny ever summed up here. Mine would sellotape a tenner to the box too...but sellotape all sides. Was like surgery to get it off intact."
That's not true at all. Ignorance is choosing not to be informed. Uninformed is simply not yet having the facts and says nothing of mindset. There is a reason English has all of these words. It's the subtle differences.
"&gt;damage

95% of gunshot victims survive with medical treatment.  Also overpenetration is a thing, meaning that if you're using an assault rifle (or really any of the ""dubiously legal"" firearms) you're likely going to not be doing much damage at all.

&gt;there's a lot of factors involved

"Ok, I'm all about pointing out the sometimes-strange priorities in the debate, but your examples are terrible.

The one that ""mirrors the recent reporter shooting""?  It was a fight between two students in which no one died *or was even hospitalized*.  In what possible way does this ""mirror"" the murder of the two reporters in Roanoke (which is what I assume you're referring to)?

As for the Franklin school incident, that too didn't involve anyone actually dying.  So while it was a terrible thing, I think this only works on a pretty ridiculous straw man of the pro-gun-control side.  If I were on that side (and I am to a point), I would point out just that: because the person used a knife, rather than a gun, he wasn't able to actually kill anyone, and he was subdued after *only 5 minutes*.  This is in stark contrast to the various mass shootings that have occurred at schools and other similar groupings of people."

&gt;Weather or not settlements are good, bad, legal or otherwise, they don't equal terrorist attacks. Does Palestine want peace and a state of their own? This is not how they achieve it.

"I'm wondering if the entire *idea* of single issue comics is the problem. I wonder what the sales are for a Batgirl TPB (for instance) would be compared to the sales of the single issues.  

If you think about it, and I hate to use this term, but are ""millennials"" going to still support the comics industry as it is now? Many of the DCYou titles are pitched to a teen/early 20s audience, and that audience isn't really in the habit of going to a store every week, buying a few issues at a time, waiting a month, and then buying back issues. I wonder how many just download comics digitally or pick up TPBs from bookstores/Amazon. Because TPBs aren't as time-sensitive, it's entirely possible that a reader won't get to a DCYou title until after it's cancelled. "
"1) Now that capes are here, will we see some sort of ""simple"" cloak with or without a hood in the future?

2) Will capes be changed later, so that your ass does not clip through it?

3) Will there ever be a slot for primary weapons, similar to the stance slot on melee?

4) Will there ever be a mission where you ride a kubrow as a mount?"
"Your name makes me want a RiotZ game type. You would have to defend your nexus vs a horde of Riot employee themed zombies.

Could even have good friends design each others zombies so you could have some fun with it."
"Salon doesn't compare to Breitbart when it comes to being ideologically insane.

Bias is only a problem when facts are completely ignored.  Regardless of its left-leaning nature, Salon isn't known for ignoring facts while most right wing sources often do.  That's a major distinction that should not be lost on anyone.

If you notice from the other sources that have been cited by others, they back up what Salon pointed out.  This proves the point I just laid out and Salon deserves the credit you didn't give them for calling it like it is."
"Will be hard to tell. Generally the tickets for Europe sell in the following order:

Season ticket holders 3 match package (for a period of time)

Season ticket holders can then buy additional 3 match packages (for friends, family etc) for a short period of time

After this, General sale 3 match package 

Then if there are any tickets left, individual match tickets can be bought.

If it was the Champions League, it wouldn't get to the individual ticket stage. Europa League last season did get to the individual ticket stage as they only opened the lower half of the stadium cause the teams we were playing were a bit meh for lots of people to bother going, which was a shame (but understandable).

This time, we're playing some pretty exciting games, so whole stadium should be open. You'll just need to keep an eye out on the website to see how they're selling tickets. I would be surprised if it **didn't**  reach the individual match tickets stage so hopefully you should be able to get a ticket for that match. Just keep checking the website/social media for ticket updates."
"When I was deployed I went to the port o shitter to take a dump, and mid dump we started getting mortared. It was only a few rounds, and at least it helped the process of getting shit to exit my body faster."
"That's really silly. US is much more of an outlier than Australia is. I'd say if we followed one of the dozens of gun control strategies that our first world peers employ, we'd end up *exactly* *like* *they* *are*.

American exceptionalism makes people stop thinking critically. We're not special or unique. What works in England would work here."

Section 4.5

4.5 Fundraising

With the exception of fundraising for such officially supported activities as the Government of Canada Workplace Charitable Campaign, employees may not solicit gifts, hospitality, other benefits or transfers of economic value from a person, group or organization in the private sector which has dealings with the Government of Canada. When fundraising for charitable organizations in the workplace, employees should obtain prior written authorization from the Senior Officer for Values and Ethics in order to solicit donations, prizes or contributions in kind from external organizations or individuals.

Similarly, if an outside individual or entity, with whom Environment Canada has past, present or potential official dealings, offers a benefit to the Department such as funding for an event or a donation of equipment, employees are to consider whether any real, apparent or potential conflict of interest exists, and obtain the consent in writing of the Senior Officer for Values and Ethics prior to accepting any such benefit. The Senior Officer for Values and Ethics may require that the activities be modified or terminated where it is determined that there is a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest or an obligation to the donor. These solicitation provisions are designed to ensure that this Code is consistent with paragraph 121.(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; they are not intended to prevent employees from taking part in charitable works.

"I'm ordering a new setup tomorrow, purely for gaming and I am unsure whether to go for the i5-6600K or i7-6700K CPU! Which one should i go for, and what are the benefits of getting an i7 if the i5 is recommended?"
"Had asthma since I was 3 and from my experience, smoking tobacco closes your airways whereas smoking cannabis opens them. I do get wheezy when blazing but after a bit of time, I tend to cough up a lot of stuff and eventually I breathe easier as the cannabis forces up phlegm. However, its still smoke so its not ideal for your lungs. I'm currently in the process of getting a Storz&amp;Bickel Volcano as vaporizing cannabis is way less harmful."
"*Before hitting the treeline, the girl's words stop me. Setting the pan down once more not to spill, I have a brow raised at the girl. Normally a girl in the nude would have me awkward and concerned, but so far I seem to be handling myself well. Mayne I should thank Sawa later...*

"Whoops, I'm a derp. For some reason I thought 280, not 240. Looked at the 140's not the 120's. You'd think I would know better. Clearly, I do not. (I blame my week.)

**YES!** You can fit a 240 and a single drive cage (3 disk) from the *top*, but not the bottom. It will be a tight fit, but should be workable. Outlets for the radiator also must go on the bottom - there isn't going to be room at the top."
"This is great. Never seen this on the sub last time around. Ill be sure to drop by this guys twitch and check him out! As for me, my names spongebob, i can be a massive douche when ive had a bad day but... I dont stream on those days because i just want to entertain whoever i can.
Im not the greatest but i'm getting better every day and my team mates dante and bbmooose (shand and brian) are always there to provide some noise too! 

Twitch.tv/user/spongebob1255 i do stream a little later in the day (Construction keeps me busy) but i have a small fan base and get to know them fairly well. Come have a chat if you have time! :)"
"That can't be the reason you can't name your own lobby. They already have a mature language filter and could block various words from being included. I think the current naming system is fine though I wish you could tag it or let players know what precisely your settings/desired gameplay is. My issue is with the implementation of lobby rules, like kicking pending players, AFK hosts, etc. There have been these issues in the lobby rules since WOL but Blizz was very slow responding to them. "
"&gt; but I legitimately am way better than average in terms of education level, financial literacy, and data analysis. I'm special!

Yea but the ""average"" investor literally doesn't even come close to matching their chosen indexes. So even matching the index makes you above average: http://www.businessinsider.com/investors-miss-stock-market-rallies-charts-2014-10

"The reason that pisses me off is that in the previous round against OKC [Kobe missed another game winner and Pau saves the day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orsbX3HrUmE) to eliminate the Thunder instead of going to game 7.

Then the next round, Artest saves the Lakers from possibly being down 2-3. If that's not some bs, I don't know what is."
"I've got no idea what kind of training he received, but if your job includes the possibility of being in danger you should prepare yourself for that until you're comfortable reacting appropriately, and if you're not, then *you're not cut out for the job*. Airline pilots train for all kinds of insane situations so that they can react appropriately and calmly if it ever happens for real."
"This one is great because it ties into the fact women think they can pick and choose who they get attention from.

Women absolutely dress certain ways when they go out and seek a boyfriend/sexual attention. High Heels, short pencil skirt, a push up bra for the goods to be shown. 

The second they get approached by the wrong guy they act like they were walking down a street in Saudi Arabia in a Burqa. "

"Wait, so other then being irresponsible enough to buy off an untrustworthy vendor, and irrationally stressing about whether they'll be arrested (when the reality is next to no consumers on these sites do), what else do buyers do but sit at home and not worry about anything except for the fact that their order hasnt updated as fast as they're used to on Amazon? Half of you kids would have been shut up quickly and never  came back in the old Silk Road days when the forum was the only means of communicating with the community. The day this subreddit became the main source of communication, it's only been downhill. 

That's not too far back for you though, is it? I'm assuming you've been around since the original Silk Road as well with the way you speak."
"I respect that, it sounds like you work for a good franchise who rewards hard work.  I did not, however.  I like to work hard and do my best no matter what, which is why I stayed as long as I did.  When I did extra work and picked up the slack for others, people became complacent and took it for granted.  I recognize the experience is not universal across the board, and may have left me a bit cynical and jaded.  It does seem to be the rule rather than the exception though, at least in my experience.  I have moved on to a better job since.

I am not fond of any employer who actively tries to squash unions though."
"&gt; Hantavirus

And this is why Google is the worst thing to happen to medicine in ages. 

Don't believe Dr Google.  Hantavirus is really rare outside of the southwestern US.  There are plenty of other things that can cause asthma and breathing problems from inhaling rat droppings.  The most basic of these is ASTHMA FROM BREATHING RAT DROPPINGS.  That's it. The shit is literally aggravating to the lungs.

Not every spider bite is a brown recluse, but when you diagnose via Dr Google, you're sure you're going to die.

The screen will look blurry when you move around in game. I can see a huge difference between my acer 144hz and an ips. That being said almost all gaming tn panels are marketed as 1ms even though with overdrive set to extreme the gtg is like 3ms.
"Are you salty? Cause honestly as a Giants fan I have no hate for the Patriots. Wish they didn't win the past Superbowl, but don't hate them. Tom Brady is great. Welker was awesome. Gronk is cool. Edelman is cool. Etc."
"The apostrophe after the ""s"" means the possession of multiple owners. He basically made the title more clever.

To be an even bigger grammar nazi, ""Five Freddy's at Freddy's"" should be ""Five Freddies at Freddy's."""
"I disagree. I think it's going to be here in a year or two at the most. Technology progresses a lot faster that you think. Self driving cars would have been a fantasy 5 years ago, and now their practically here. We didn't make any progress in AI for decades in the 20th century, but we are now on the verge of full fledged strong AI. I mean the subreddit is filled with new stuff literally every day.

I'm pretty confident about my position right now. I guess I'm just looking for a way to convince someone who is a bit old fashioned and a bit out of touch with technology."
"&gt; The lack of registering anger as an emotion on reddit blows my mind

Similarly, the accusation of anger towards a strictly logical response. Many times if someone disagrees with a point another user passionately makes, that user is then accused of ""being angry"", as if that somehow dismisses or disproves their point. 

Tone policing is never an actual rebuttal."
"... Not as amusing as I was hoping.

But yeah. Unless you follow up with something like ""It's aerodynamically perfect for outrunning cops after stealing an old lady's purse. With my brains and your skull, we can terrorize elderly people everywhere.""... that had no hope of not being awkward."
"Perhaps... I'll have to go look at some code that may potentially have this bug, but I wouldn't call this horribly broken. This is a bug that only occurs after 2.2 billion requests to the line same code. As Spotify mentioned it took over 700 days for it to be realized on their end. Even if you have a yearly maintenance window where you restart your services with this sort of code in it, you'd likely never encounter this sort of thing. Even then, imagine you encounter this bug in the wild... you restart your program, and you don't hit it for another 700 days. I'm honestly surprised they tracked it down, it shows the power of postmortems. I imagine most would just ""turn it off and on again"" and walk away."
"Yea, right, because Reddit is a good place to learn about world culture. 

I used to want to go to America, but Reddit has taught me that it's nothing, but fat people shooting each other while getting shot by police who just shot some guy shooting up a school."
"Yeah. That actually sounds more awesome. I mean, I even liked the current HoTS immortal because the damage from would be capped to 10. And this is where I think I prefer a shield regen unit compared to a force field where cool decisions like the sentry could use its energy to regenerate immortal shields and therefore it has to remain within certain range allowing you to micro it, the closer you are the quicker you regen the further you are the slower the regen Also allows for more micro on units rather on the landscape and we will finally see how bad gateway units actually are and why protoss pretty much feel like we have to deathball. "
"No mouse on the screen - i actually tried to re install windows 7 today and am having the exact same issue! never had this problem before trying to upgrade to win10, very frustrating! but am starting to wodner if windows 10 is even related"
"Awww it's no fun if you stop trying.

So I like how your site is like 92% Russian.  If how you do the site is like how you do your scripts I think I understand why they haven't been working until recently.  

Enjoy making new accounts over and over!"
"The last one I went to was Drupalcon Chicago a few years ago. I usually go with a friend just to help me through the noise (no pun intended), but I usually just go to learn and find out what's new in the Drupal realm. I try to sit up front close enough where I can lip read somewhat well and I haven't bothered with an CART or interpreter (yet) as I don't want it to be distracting to me or anyone else.

I'm likely going to the next Drupalcon (in America) since my company I work with is likely paying for me to go, and I'd be going with co-workers I talk to via chat/email often so it won't be so bad!

I take it you're familiar with Drupal? I'm working on http://uDeaf.com as one of my own projects, which I'm building on Drupal. Feel free to email me (from my site) if you're interested in chatting sometime. "
Deandre Jordan is huge factor in why we have any success. Doc did the right thing by investing in his development when other people might not have been as patient. Without him we wouldn't be able to have such a fast paced style of play that allows for one of the best offenses in the league.
"Sorry to disappoint you but I was actually just sarcastically making fun of the other guy

It sounds like you agree with me actually. Spoiling something shouldn't be okay if it's old. Or at least not 10 years old. "
"Their profit was declining, but overall they did fine[[1]](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/Investor_Relations/Financial_summary_report). And the decline in profit was expected as they only release one game every few years and the company has to be kept running with the money Gog generates which is some money but not this much."
"Love DSOTM and played it over and over again as a kid in the 90s. Still one of my favourites. I really like lazaretto but don't own it on vinyl, will have to check it out. Never got my head wrapped around the clash but will consider!"
"I guess this is why most ""nice guys"" who do manage to end up in relationships, tend to follow their partner's every whim and command, and ignore their own needs, desires, and thoughts in order to stay in their partner's favor . . ."
"Since Jason Aaron wrote Original Sin, and is continuing to write Thor, my guess is that it will eventually be revealed in Thor, after Secret Wars, whenever Jane's time comes to and end. Indeed, I'm thinking that revelation might come sooner rather than later, as the Odinson was revealed to no longer be ""unworthy"" just before his and Hyperion's final throwdown with the Beyonders (he could no longer lift the alt-reality Thorr's unworthy Mjolnir)."
"Hi ! I'll give it a try :-)



Il ne pleut pas **ou** vous avez besoin de la pluie ? (*où* is used only to talk about a location, English ""or"" becomes ""ou"" without accent)

Vous pouvez attraper des nuages chargés **d'eau** pour **les relâcher là où c'est nécessaire**.

L’attrapeur de nuage consiste **en un** petit *récipient* (Are you sure about this one? Is it a container, such as a glass or bowl?) avec la technologie **la** plus moderne.

Il est très facile **à** utiliser. 

Vous devez chercher et choisir le nuage que vous désirez. 
Ensuite, vous devez ouvrir le récipient, le pointer vers le nuage et appuyer le bouton rouge. (Seems odd, maybe you can try something like ""Cherchez le nuage que vous souhaitez, ouvrez le récipient [Still seems odd here, see above comment], pointez le vers le nuage et appuyez sur le bouton rouge"")

Le nuage sera aspiré et attrapé. (Correct :-D )

Pour **le relâcher** où vous désirez, **ouvrez simplement** le récipient [Still seems odd] et appuyez **sur** le bouton vert. 

Vous pouvez acquérir L'attrapeur de nuage pour seulement $40. (Correct but odd... In commercial, it's mostly sentences like ""L'attrapeur de nuage ne vous en coûtera que $40"")

C'est une solution écologiquement sûre et économique **afin** de lutter **contre** la sécheresse.




Another opinion may still be needed but, it's a start ! :-D

"I don't like them, but that's because I'm a slob and every time I wear anything white (wedding dress included) I immediately stain it within 15 minutes of putting it on.  

Soooooo, yeah.  With jeans in my opinion it's less about the color and all about the cut, so if you find a cut or style you like, buy it, try it on, and if you like it, wear it, if you don't like it, send it back!"
"Eehhh the only things that could go in a 1 gallon would be shrimp or snails. With that said they still need to have proper lighting, filtration, a heater and a lid. That would pretty difficult to accomplish with a bowl. But one thing you could have is marimo balls!! They are really beautiful. Could also think about having succulents! "
"They are very slowly starting to trickle out. We have a couple stores near us that had some, but not all the stores yet. And I've seen people in NY with them. Ask your local to look up the WIC, it should tell them when their first shipment of these is coming in. "
"~~The two brothers, Rick and Morty. They have a strong bond. I don't need to tell you about it here, but I can tell you one thing. Kaiju... Are comin'.~~

~~Really though, they would be good for this.~~

well - not necessarily. if laws pass banning ownership and people who have openly professed their ownership refuse to hand them over i think warrants could be issued without repealing the 4th. certainly shakier warrants have been issued.
"Depends on your rank and your ""prefered"" faction to go against.

Seems like you didn't hit the Void yet too.

I'd say the Lex/AkLex. You can't go wrong with them, and a Lex costs 50k credits in the market. Mod for crit chance and dmg. I've used them throughout the Starchart of yore alongside a Tigris, and I'd dare say they were quite a good combination ""to get there"".

Melt beefy faces from up close and personal, punch holes in heads from afar.

However now I'm not too sure. Things have changed. I'd say change these for other gear at some point. Eris will be a pain to fully unlock with them for instance."
"It's not stupid because this is how it was supposed to be from the start. Instead of /5 it's /4 so everyone 'completed' it once, in other words it'll take the same amount of time.

The only reason some people had one extra completion was because of a bug, and Gaz let the people keep their extra ultimate upgrade token but also equalized progress to not have some people get Howard a whole event early because of, again, a bug."
"Because they have to if they want a job in their industry.

For many industries, the vast majority, or even ALL of the jobs are centered in big cities.  Also, they usually pay well enough to live in the city.

Even though many costs are much higher, like rent, some costs stay about the same, like food and video games and such.  So if you're making a bigger paycheck and can afford rent, you have more spending money for other stuff.

Also, it is a hotbed of culture and activity.  People who like to see live music, go out to restaurants, etc. live in a city because there is much, much more of it there.  They make more money, and thus have more to spend on that sort of thing."
"I'm not pretending anything. I'm telling you that you are incorrect when you say some photos of bruises and a simple allegation is sufficient.

Your comments are getting more and more bizarre. There is strong evidence against Browne. Why do you have to exaggerate it?

Edit: spelling"
"Not sure where you live, but in Boston there are new buildings going up like crazy. Yeah housing is a bit expensive, but I was lucky enough to find a good paying job. At least here I definitely notice the upswing."
"I know this video is awesome, but marshawn totally sucks; he's got real high mileage and is the wrong side of 30; christine michael is totally going to break out this year; jimmy graham is going to take all the redzone opportunities.

So yeah, everyone should just ignore him in the draft."
"If we're talking about system versus system, specific games don't matter. 

If we're talking about game versus game, Genealogy is the worst point of comparison. 

This is why RJWalker got irritated. I happen to think Fates has a reasonable case for best weapon balance, incidentally. "
"Thanks for your advice. Unfortunately I'm a bit tight with real currency at the moment, which is why I'm trying my luck with Steam items.  

It's interesting to know this is a low offer though. I calculated at the sale price and it came to:  
CSGO: $7.49  
Deponia Complete: $5.99  
FTL: $2.49  
1.5 TF2 keys: ~$2.8  
Total: $18.77  

I'm aware $1 Steam currency =/= $1 real currrency though. Maybe if I add another item to make it $20+, this might help? I have two days to figure this out I guess... "
"Leaving it cleaner though, where did all that eurethane go?  Sure the marks are gone but did the actual substances vanish from existence?  Burning Man likes to say ""leave no trace"" but the trace is simply distributed.  Picking up the trash is all well and good the point is to NOT MAKE ANY TRASH IN THE FIRST PLACE.  "

"My gf steals the covers from the middle of the bed (she wraps them under her).  No matter how big the blankets are, this will steal them and deprive me of warmth through the night.  Just get two small blankets each."
That is actually *the* typical punitivist viewpoint. It's intuitive but in practice it does not achieve the goal of making society safer. It's a viewpoint not founded on the knowledge of human behaviour.
"I don't understand how inflation works in the context of Pucatrade. Isn't the PP value of a card essentially equal to it's price in dollars, and aren't points purchased at the rate of $1 to 100 points? It seems pretty locked-in to me."
"UofM is an odd choice, but OSU has been the most consistent B1G team for about two decades. You can pick darn near any (reasonable) stretch and that time frame and you'll likely find OSU at the top.

The last 5 years Ohio State is 56-11 (.836) with a BCS win (I know it was later deemed inellegible), a NY6 bowl win, an undefeated season, two conference championships, and a National Title. 7 of those 11 loses came from the transition year between coaches.

Michigan State is definitely the #2 team in that time span. MSU has gone 53-14 (.791), and just like Ohio State has won a BCS bowl, a NY6 bowl, and two conference championships.

There's a pretty solid drop off to #3 (Wisconsin) and an even steeper drop off after that. As an MSU fan, I'd be kind of insulted they'd mention UofM over MSU. It's like people assume Harbaugh is going to immediately bring back their glory days despite the empires Dantonio and Meyer have already built in the same division."

"“Hey Joe, have you noticed anything weird about this bookcase?"" 

We had stopped by the local library to deliver some fantasy novels Joe had borrowed earlier. While he tried negotiating his way out of a bill for not delivering a book about drawing the autonomy on elves for like 5 months. I had begun wandering but I didn’t come farther than the school book section right past the counter when I noticed something peculiar about the shelf. “Not now Pete, they’re trying to push charges over here. 25 dollars man!” I rolled my eyes. “Well maybe if you weren’t so busy drawing that Wow p…” I was quickly interrupted by myself as I left out an audible gasp. “Joe, I'm serious. Are you not seeing…this?” I looked over at him as he hung his head down and paid the charges. 

I think I heard something about the clerk threatening to call the police. “Fine, let’s take a look at- HOLY MOTHER OF JOSEPH.” 

“Sssshhhh”. A crass sound came from a fellow library goer. I have to wonder how he hasn’t noticed the borderline wormhole in front of us.

“What IS that?” I said a little bit more quietly as to not provoke anymore people.

“You tell me!” said Joe.

“Is it a wormhole? Is it some kind of intergalactic time paradox??” I said.

“Whatever it is we probably shouldn’t stare at the cent-“

As he finished the sentence he was gone. He vanished, out of thin air. I screamed and got the attention of the whole library. Suddenly there was voices all around me. “What is THAT?”

“By the bookcase! Is that some sort of hole?”

“Did somebody break reality??”

You could feel the panic building in the air, as I looked around me I noticed more and more people vanishing. One after one, disappearing after the looking at the centre of the hole. I began making a run for the door. Time slowed down. I couldn’t move properly. My arms became spaghetti, it felt as if I was moving through a pool of 3 month old menstruation blood! And then the library around me disappeared. I was floating in mid-air as I was slowing falling down. Then the ground under me disappeared.

And suddenly, the world ceased to exist.

"As an aside, and not to shit on your opinion or anything, but I personally had the opposite reaction. To me it was my worst ""final battle.""  There was no communication, the villain was basically introduced within the last 4 episodes, no emotional investment, it was a low visibility fist fight in the blurry snow...

To its credit, it's certainly a unique and memorable final battle even despite Kuuga being my least liked series. For me, it's a relief that the subsequent Kamen Rider series had more fitting epic battles. "
"Circle of life on the gunslinger should be looked at this the one where getting a throwing knife kill while in golden gun extends the time of your golden gun.

But then again maybe that would be too overpowered with celestial nighthawk in PvE, just a thought."

However the assumption that that is the ""end"" of something that previously had a ""beginning"" is a purely human point of view."

"1. Yes, scraped crushed rock landscaping (fairly flat, semi-compacted) just protruding above above the curb. (Grocery store type landscaping)

2. Not at all (Cringe)

3. Car was loaded, the door just cleared it when passenger got out

4. About 2/3 open when it scraped

5. C5 (lowered less than 1/2"" on stock bolts, stock tire sizes)

Honestly, the current height I feel is adequate and above is a consequence of not being careful enough. But I don't think that allowing much less clearance would be beneficial from a user standpoint. I would much rather step over a little more sill than worry about parking next to curbs.

*edit -consequentially, I also just barely scraped a few hairs off the nose the other day on a forward curb. I would never have guessed was tall enough &amp; havn't had any issues before with standard height curbs, obviously avoiding any non-standard appearing ones. While I absolutely wouldn't raise the front nose height, I think forward parking sensors should be standard.

*edit 2 -One other thought - I would much rather see the length of the door decease slightly as about 99% of my parking issues result in being to close to Garage walls/other cars to comfortably get out of (at least with the inward curved windows of the C5)"

"With intrigue the most important part is really just to create distinct characters with very clear motives. You need to know what each family or agent wants - what their goals are. And you need to have an idea of how they are pursuing these goals. 

You can also simplify things by putting families or guilds into groups or factions. Sort of like political parties. Group X thinks lower tarriffs on imports would boost trade. They are made up of wealthy traders merchants, and nobles who have investments in that area. 

Group Y is concerned about foreign influence on the city. They want to increase the authority of the local guard, and build temples to the traditional Gods. Maybe they're a bit Xenophobic.

 Group Z is an upstart crime syndicate, who is more brash (and to many more dangerous) than those in recent history. They take what they want and seem to have little regard for who gets in the way. 

These are just a few examples, and you can make as many 'factions' as you please, but I find it helpful because now when you make an NPC you can ask, ""What camp does she belong to? What does she want personally, and how does that relate to the group's ideals?""

Eventually, as the players (and their characters) go about their business and interact with some of these NPCs, they should start to choose one side over another. This will (and should) create inter-party conflict, and ideally compromise and character growth.

As far as combat goes, if you're not comfortable with (or your PC's don't seem to be the type to engage in) a war of shadows, then you can still do your standard ('kill the orcs') style quests, but have each one be offered by different factions with different rewards. Now the party, after having slain the orcs will go 'OK do we go to Group X for the magic item reward or tell the guy from group Y about the letter the Orc Chieftan had.' 

You're giving the players a choice in how their actions affect they city and its dynamics. Maybe that magic item wasn't really his to give? Maybe that letter contains evidence of conspiracy from one of the rich noble families? The trick here is to give the players options, but not think to far ahead about what they might do (because they will rarely do what you expect). This is where improv and making things up on the fly comes into play (and its the part that I find the most difficult).

I might have started rambling just now, but I hope at least some of that helps!"
"I remember a kid in high school.  first tee in one of our first matches and he's in my foursome.  match play golf.  He pumps his first 4 shots out of bounds right.  never changed clubs, never changed facial expression.  he's hitting 9 off the tee and makes an 11 on the par 4.  From that point on he shot -1 and won I think +6 or +7 holes in his match.  I learned a lesson that day.  "
"Possible, but way slower than it needs to be :/ Taking it to 5 with credits is doable and I encourage it because it's hard to farm without AT nades.

"Its mostly a linguistic thing. When people learn a second language, they usually retain certain qualities of their native language. An example for Americans learning German is that they often can't pronounce the 'ch' which has that harsh palatal sound. Instead they usually use hard 'K' or 'Sh' sounds. Grammatically, people often have trouble remembering to tack the infinitive verbs at the end of the sentence. It just reflects that my pronunciation and understanding of the language is very good.

As for traveling, I've never ran into any real issues being an American abroad. It's more of a courtesy thing. But if you are interacting with shop keepers or just everyday people and you're speaking *their* language so well they can't even tell where you are from AND then they find out you're an American I swear to God they melt in your hands. Germans have, in my experience, this peculiar tendency to get weird when others express an interest in German culture. They really don't like to seem as if they are forcing German-ness on you (take a shot in the dark about why). So if you immediately show that you have an interest in their language and culture, they get very appreciative! 

I also love to debunk the dumb-uncultured American stereotype when ever possible!"
"I agree with /u/Lovelyfeathereddinos, you should check around to see if anyone in your area (community college, local parks and recreation department, private jeweler or jewelry school) offers classes, where you can use their soldering and casting equipment at first.

My first teacher started us out on chain making to learn how to make jump rings, how to close them properly so their ends were flush, and how to solder. 

Using basically the same techniques we learned how to use larger, half-round wire to make band-style rings - some plain and some decorated by removing metal with files, etc. We also learned to add bezels to them to hold stones.

We eventually learned how to make our own silver sheet and wire from scrap, which was a good technical lesson as well as a way to save money on materials.

He had us learn the basics of shaping jeweler's wax before he turned us loose on casting, using the school's equipment.

If you study the history of jewelry and jewelry making you'll find that people were producing beautiful pieces for hundreds and even thousands of years with very simple - even primitive, equipment. You can get into it at basically any price point, if you're willing to do the work.

A relatively inexpensive propane torch with disposable tanks, both of which you can buy at a big box DIY store or even Walmart, is enough to get you started on both soldering and casting. There are also smaller refillable butane torches, sort of glorified cigarette lighters, that you can buy in the same places. They are good for small jobs like soldering chains and rings.

There are a ton of great resources online, on YouTube and sites like Ganoskin.com, where you can learn all about this stuff - and watch people do it step by step. 

Tim McCreight has written some extremely useful books on the subject. Check your local library or used book sources to save a little money on them.

Don't buy dollar store tools, but you also don't need to spend a fortune to get started. The important thing is doing the work, even if you have to start small.

I've had a little luck over the years finding gold and silver to work with, sometimes for pennies on the dollar, at yard sales, rummage/tag sales, estate sales, thrift shops etc. 

I used to live in a town with a pawn shop where I could buy fancy silver stock, like tube, sheet, and wire - as well as jewelry findings, for spot or spot+5%.

I've also had luck on eBay with people looking to get out of the hobby unloading their materials and equipment for cheap. You can also save some money by starting out on cheaper metals like copper, bronze, and pewter - but they will will have their own working methods.

Good luck!"

"Lamb is a fairly common option on most of the Indian restaurant menus in town.  It's also very common in Greek cooking.  The thing about lamb is that it's similar to every other kind of meat in that there are both cheap, and expensive cuts.  A rack of lamb is probably the most expensive cut from the animal, and I think everyone expects to pay a lot for it.  But a lamb shank is a cheaper cut that's still horribly over priced.

"I would agree that was the case 100 years ago. In modern society we have birth control, condoms, and medicine negating the harmful effects of large amounts of intercourse. I would propose the time where that was necessary is over and to advance again a communal style is preferable giving larger numbers of hours total to spend with each child and allowing those that don't want children a chance to be directly involved.

They do but typically for different reasons. Some more recent RTS have toyed with limited health recovery which would promote the kind of tactics /u/zed1207 is referring to. However in most RTS micromanaging units is important for the purpose of drawing the opponent out of formation. This really doesn't apply with riot tactics.
"Fighting strength isnt everything also. The reason I like zoro more than sanji is because sanji's whiteknighting pisses me off, at ennies lobby he literally could have gotten robin killed just for the sake of not hitting kalifa. I know it worked out with nami showing up, and it gave her an opponent,and kalifa's key wasnt needed for anything, but if nami hadnt shown up and kalifa's key was needed for robins cuffs or to seperate the legendary nose storm sword then sanji would have literally gotten crew members killed over his stupid chivalry. Also he has jobbed really hard since the new world started so that plays a role too."
"Premise is a bit strong, but it's more than a minor detail. If they were bi-directional, Daniel Jackson would have never been needed on the first mission, which would have ended with disaster when Ra showed up and found some humans with a nuclear bomb inhabiting his temple. Other plots like *Prisoners* and *A Matter of Time* wouldn't work if you could enter the wormhole from either side.

On the whole, it would be insanely dangerous to dial out, so the whole Stargate program would probably have to be moved off-world."
"I don't exactly think you're wrong, but I think that people who participate in these types of things are escapists who are often dissatisfied with the present reality. I think these things help us to understand our world and make decisions about how we should shape the world. So maybe these things have a masturbatory component, but I make the argument that these things aren't entirely trivial. If we go extinct (which seems almost certain) then you're right, but maybe we transcend the entropy of our current universe and star trek appreciation becomes a ideology that guides the moral decisions of future societies."

"No.  Empathy doesn't turn off.  It just turns cold.  And that happens only with bad states of mind where you have nothing or you see the world as a world of competitors even within your inner circle.

Since we are supposed to be in the belt of a sun, the meteors should come from at a right angle from the sun, with a slight variety of angles.

Meteors should be slightly distinct, but their trails should be extremely small or very transparent. Can they also become a qusi-physical object (with a new model) so their impacts aren't just explosions, along with leaving some driftin ores and/or adding voxels to astriods if they impact them.

This is alot, but it would make them realistic, and give them *A* benfit, being the fact they drop ores."

"Yeah - I'm leaning towards skipping this one, but I don't think AA is a bad underdog bet. The lower the overall level of play and the more unexpected variables there are (like stand-ins), the more it favors the underdog, IMO. I wouldn't put anything more than a super low bet either way though."

"He definitely overpaid for the price of the gold crown, even if it was 100% gold.  There's no arguing that point.  Even throw in a 20% increase on price, he's still overpaid by at least $300.  I know that you might feel the need to defend your complete rip-off of an industry.  You can try to spin this any which way you want.  And talk about cherry picking...  Wow, kid.  You latched onto the $100 comment like it was the only thing said.  It's amazing how you ignored the entire context of the statement and still refuse to admit that this man was overcharged for a crown.  That really shows how far people in the dental industry will go to defend the indefensible price structure.  

&gt;so I am going to have to conclude that you are a sad angry individual who hides behind the internet and spits venom because you have not done well in life. Failed dental student? Spurned by a dentist lover? Angry assistant/hygienist that is jealous of the dentist? Neckbeard?

Talk about name calling.  Just more banter from an ignorant moron attempting to defend the industry that thrives on ripping people off.  Son, I'm much more successful than you will ever be. 

&gt;The fact of the matter is, I have seen hundreds of offices lab bills over the last few years. I know that the average office is paying $120 - $180 dollars for quality crowns.

According to this very same thread, $140 crowns come from China.  That is the opinion of the moderator of /r/dentistry who I began the argument with.  Given that I was told to talk with the ""professionals"" on /r/dentistry about the prices (none of whom were willing to back up their statements by posting their lab fees except for one which showed a crown in your price range), I can only assume that your crowns must be manufactured in China.  As I'm not in the dental field (onc here), I can only assume that these ""professionals"" must be correct and that you must be mistaken as to where your crowns are manufactured.  My entire freakin' point was that a crown does not cost that much to make.  And you're telling me, ""Hey, a crown doesn't cost that much to make,"" while the moderator from /r/dentistry in this very same thread is saying, ""A quality crown costs a lot more than that to make.""  Yet, in your infinite ignorance and stupidity, you have a beef with me, rather than the person who is saying that your so-called quality crowns must be manufactured in China because they cost too little.  Frankly, you look like an idiot because you're arguing my exact points and you don't even realize it! 

&gt;As for your study? I want to see it. Were the crowns seated? Were they lined up on a table and visually inspected? Were there tests on hell well they held up? What was the material? How many correctly identified the $25 crown, but had trouble distinguishing the $180 crown from the $325 crown? Were these anteriors or posteriors?

Do your own leg work.  I'm not here to help lazy people.

&gt;What exactly are you trying to say here? You can't have this much anger over the fact that dentists pay ""too much"" for their crowns.

You really should read the entire thread.  Reading is fundamental.  My anger stems from a moderator of /r/dentistry (the same one in this thread saying that $140 crowns must be made in China) trying to push somebody onto another PPO plan after their current PPO plan has been exhausted.  For those that need extensive dental work, couple a PPO plan with an HMO plan.  The PPO plan can be used for certain things that the HMO plan doesn't cover.  The HMO plan has lower out of pocket costs to the patient and doesn't have an annual maximum.  For somebody needing extensive dental work, this is the way to go.  It's not financially responsible to spend the (in this person's case) $50 a month ($600 per year) for a plan that's only going to provide ""$1350 worth of services for $806"" when an HMO plan for around $150 per year would provide a heck of a lot more benefit.  Then, the /r/dentistry moderator claimed that HMO dentists must use lower quality material because the amount they can charge is less than a PPO dentist.  I mentioned what the actual cost of a crown was and apparently the dental world decided to take a shit on me for revealing the truth that a quality crown (i.e. the material in the equation) only costs $140.  Yes, I more than understand that the crown isn't the only part of the cost equation.  I'm not ignorant to the overhead costs of medicine.  But, when somebody claims that somebody must use lower quality material in order to make up for costs when the cost of said material isn't the main contributing cost to the service...they are doing nothing but bullshitting.  And I take great offense to see a so-called professional lie about it in order to attempt to get this person to sign up for something they don't need.     


Wouldn't you be angry if you knew you were right and somebody continually told you that you were wrong?  If I sat here and continually said, ""Nope.  Your crowns are cheap crowns made in China.  They have to be for that low price,"" would you take offense even though you know that you have quality crowns?

"The tank should still be ahead on threat and even if they aren't, it's the DPS's responsibility to tab over and attack another target until some of their threat dissipates.

"I appreciate the readings, but I don't find myself agreeing with them.  IMHO, man can find a sense of community and purpose in the service of others while working in a market that is still held by private interests.  Lots of people have benifited from capitalism and have used it to help their fellow mankind.

Then again, sociology isn't an objective science and is rather subjective.  Add to that the whole human factor affects all the variables.  Since we aren't robots we cannot truely measure which system is the best.  So I can see how you think capitalists are so evil, but on the other hand the largest genocides in history have been at the hands of your communist breathern.

I won't ever claim that capitalism is perfect, but trying to blame so many of societies problems on it is ridiculous.

"I like it a lot more than xannies for a couple of reasons. It has better euphoria, it lasts longer, it doens't knock me out and it physically relaxes me more than xanax does. Somas are also awesome. They are very strong lilke xanax, but they feel shorter to me and they also knock you on your butt if you do not have a benzo tolerance. It's like being drunk a little bit without all the negative parts of being drunk.

So if you wanna be sedated all day, k-pins are awesome for that. They also aren't nearly as addictive as xannies are as well. Like someone could take clonzalam everyday for a month and not have the type of withdraw that xanax would give. THIS ISN'T TO SAY YOU DON'T WITHDRAW! It's just so much easier to deal with, at least for my experience and someone else I'm related to. I think a lot of has to do with how strong xanax is at making you give 0 fucks. Clonzo doesn't overwhelm you with not giving fucks like xanax does.

Hope any of this helps, lmk if you need something else answered."
"When you get to the college football level, the amount of stress you put on your body requires constant attention.

The injury alone made me want to smoke more and I started to care less and less.

"Thank you again for your continued support. Your really helping me out a ton here.
  
I hate to sound like a Debbie Downer all the time... but there are two issues with asking for more alone time with my wife. The first is that historically, our alone time consists of sitting on the couch and being quiet while my wife does work stuff and calls/texts Kate.  She mixes in some phone calls to her mother and takes calls from random people at work just looking to BS, but the nights Kate isn't over, it's always the same... they just talk to eachother about what they're up to.  The second thing is... if I were to ask for alone time, then it would be made clear to Kate that I'm the one asking for it and thus she'd be on her own for the night because of me.  I'm so emotionally attached to her that I simply can't do that.
  
Of course, there are times outside of our normal schedule where Kate doesn't come over.  Sometimes she works a 12 hour day, sometimes she's not feeling well, etc, etc.  Never do we cease that opportunity to do anything with just my wife and I.  Why? Partially because my wife works a lot too, so when Kate isn't here, she takes advantage and gets more rest.  In addition, everything has got to be my decision.  If we have a night alone for whatever reason, my wife asks me what I want to do.  If I have no ideas, then the couch it is.  My wife never says ""Hey I want to do this with you."" or ""Hey this looks like something fun for couples."" 
  
The other part is, we literally have nothing to do.  Kate makes my wife laugh and smile.  There are honestly times where I say or do something and get no response. But if Kate says or does that same thing, my wife smiles, laughs and is in a good mood.  I guess this goes along with how I'm the outsider in things.
 
I'll be back on in a little bit.  Thanks SO much for your support.

Relevant part from the Chris Rock interview...

&gt;In their political views?

*Not in their political views — not like they’re voting Republican — but in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody. Kids raised on a culture of “We’re not going to keep score in the game because we don’t want anybody to lose.” Or just ignoring race to a fault. You can’t say “the black kid over there.” No, it’s “the guy with the red shoes.” You can’t even be offensive on your way to being inoffensive.*

&gt;When did you start to notice this?

*About eight years ago. Probably a couple of tours ago. It was just like, This is not as much fun as it used to be. I remember talking to George Carlin before he died and him saying the exact same thing*

"I have a somewhat similar issue. This is my 2nd year in business, shooting my 10th wedding tomorrow. My style has evolved so much that there are many weddings I just removed from my site, as new ones come in. 

I've also changed my site's model. I used to have all my weddings and lots of pictures from each. Now I have a ""Recent Weddings"" section, with the past 4 or so, on the front page. I have a wedding gallery that includes the top 30 or so images I've ever taken. I find it's enough to get brides interested, as they like and connect with my style. 

Then when I meet with them, I bring my most recent albums. (I've been making new ones every 2-3 weddings lately as I start offering nicer and nicer albums with nicer weddings to showcase). In there, there are 45 images per wedding. Most aren't on my site, so I'm pulling the bride in again. If they want to see a full wedding, I send them to a Pixieset of my most recent wedding -- where my editing style and shooting is at my best.

I find that system works best. I've gone back to 1 or 2 older weddings that I still showcase to edit maybe 10-15 images. (Goodbye cross-processing my blacks to blue. yuck).  It's all I need per wedding. 

I don't delete the old blog posts from old weddings, they are still there, but just not really linked from anywhere. They are pages and pages deep in my blog, so even if a bride goes digging and finds it, she'll understand that these were from a long time ago. But I don't find most brides go very many pages deep in blogs anymore, especially if you give them what they're really looking for front and center. 

Sorry for the long winded answer to what should have been a simple question!"

"IANAL.  I am, however, part of mall security in another mall in another state.  If this group is anything like the group at my mall, they're a pain in the ass and mall security is sick of their shit.

When they first arrived a little before December last year, we had numerous problems with them and complaints from customers.  Our mall does not allow the aggressive sales tactics that this group uses, so in the beginning they received numerous lease violations, which resulted in fines to their store.  They've since calmed down considerably, however we still have issues from time to time when they bring in new workers.



What you should do, regardless of any medical or legal action:

Take photos of her arm.  

Go back to the mall and ask to speak to the officer in charge.  They should have a complaint form for you to fill out.  They'll also need to do an incident report.  Make sure you get the email of the Mall's General Manager (or whomever is in charge of things on the Mall side of things)

But you know how the saying goes: Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time (or in this case, if you don't want to pay the fine).

" That's the case at my church. We will occasionally take a door offering if funds are low or there is a big anticipated need, but most of the time we just have it built into our budget as a few important line items.

"You need to check the power steering fluid.  If you've driven it for a while making this noise you may have done permanent damage to the pump.  If the fluid is low then you have a leak, not an urgent run to the shop today type thing but something you want to have addressed in the near future."
"What's even more sad is that the politicians on the Provincial or Federal level don't seem to care now. 
At the Federal level Stephen Harper was talking about starting to collect data on the issue. It's kind of too late for that now.
Thomas Mulcairs solution is to build lots of social housing, because that's what we need to resolve this issue, become second class citizens in our own country."
"&gt; If he repeats this every month he will build his credit while not paying interest.&gt;

Having to buy something every month on the store card to build his credit would end up far more costly to his budget than just paying a minimal amount of interest on one purchased item for a short period of time.

"That's all painfully familiar... he's almost certainly suffering from depression or a related condition, and the evasion is a combination of embarrassment and ""you shouldn't have to deal with my shit."" In all likelihood he's even more frustrated with himself than you are, which is part of an internal negative feedback loop that needs to be suppressed.

As a friend, encourage him to seek professional help, and be as positive and supportive as you can -- and not just passively. Social engagement is very important. Take the attitude of ""you're my friend, you need help; I'm gonna help, deal with it."" Actually be pushy about it, within reason. Refusing to take no for an answer demonstrates that you're not just being polite.

As a business, if you can provide financial assistance to see a psychiatrist, do so. Be sympathetic and understanding; emphasize how much his past contributions have been worth to the team, and also how much your friendship is worth and that you're concerned for him personally -- he's valuable as both a friend AND an asset.

One suggestion that could help immensely if you can pull it off: talk him into livestreaming his art sessions (some of them, anyway) and have the whole team show up to watch and chat. This turns art into a social event so he has *immediate* positive feedback, not just the promise of a future reward. I don't mean live critique, the chat can (and mostly should) be unrelated to what he's doing and everyone else can be working too (for that matter you could ALL be screencasting on Hangouts or something) -- the positive aspect here is just the presence of an interested social group. The tricky part is that it needs to be clear beyond question that you're not doing this to keep an eye on him and make sure he's working -- it needs to be *genuinely* about providing that social experience. Leave no room for doubt about that. 

Finally, if you do follow my advice, he'll notice the change in how you're interacting with him. Be open and forthright about it: you looked for advice on how to handle the situation with his work issues, and gained new insight. Don't dwell on that subject, but don't hide from it either; if he had a broken arm, you wouldn't pretend not to see the sling, and you wouldn't be mad if he can't help you move your sofa. Treat this the same way, as something that everyone wants to see healed and that he doesn't need to hide from you. It sucks, but it shouldn't define who he is in his own mind, and so it has to be clear that it doesn't define him in the minds of his friends."

"Well I'm obviously not directing this at the Syrian refugees who have just gotten off the boat. 

There are *some* established Muslim communities in the UK that have yet to assimilate. I don't mean all Muslims, I know many that are very British.

"The extra benefit to this is that if the NX has a different control scheme from the WiiU, then the people who don't like the GamePad won't have the controls as an excuse not to get the game.

Of course, we could end up with a Twilight Princess situation in that most people consider the Gamecube version's controls better but the Wii has far more copies printed of the game, but digital distribution could help with that problem."
"I see where you're coming from. But if you argue that he didn't specify girls in the beginning, then you have to assume 7000 general people. But you can't take 7000 general people, then change them all to girls because she is a girl.

Low light was pretty terrible.

I haven't used the camera much on the Play, but I can tell it's a better camera already, but not by a huge margin.

Anyway, you are asking the wrong guy, because as I've noted in other parts of the thread, I don't count on my camera for photos. I have a DSLR for when I want quality shots, and my phone is for quick candid stuff. I take maybe 5 photos a month on my phone. It's just not a feature I care about."

"I don't know what the difference between very conservative and conservative is.

"&gt; years ago my mom was battling c-diff in the hospital. She was very sick from it. They tried all sorts of antibiotics and even an experimental drug to try and stop the bad bacteria in her gut.

It sounds like the doctors at your hospital had no idea what they were doing. Antibiotics **caused** my c.diff infection, and **pro**biotics made me better."
Common practice. I don't mind it as it gets passionate people telling other people about the game. I don't really consider it unethical by the company. If any standard of ethics is broken it is the referral links that get posted by the players that do not inform the readers of their own benefit/bias (such as in game rewards).
"im better off allergic to wards then being allergic to learning. Seriously  3 of my friends who i played nearly everyday with, stopped playing league because they were loosing quite badly and never progressed in elo (stuck in silver 5-3). they never wanted to learn anything on how to get better because they wanted to play for fun but they never learned the basics so they got smashed alot.

Dont think that winning normals is enough to be good enough to climb ranks. You should know when you played good and carried and when you just got carried by your team. Most of the early wins are games you got carried or you just did fine but nothing great. For solo q you HAVE to win lane otherwise its impossible to climb (unless you have a duo that carries everygame). never be ignorant and learn from your mistakes and not from the enemys. Trolls are included in everygame and they dont stop anyone from climbing &gt; they actually only put you on losestreaks at worst.

- Learn how to farm! you dont need wards , you dont need gameknowledge or huge and diverse championpools, you dont need mechanics &gt; all you need is the ability to outfarm your opponent at any time. Learn how to farm, learn how to freeze and learn how to slowpush. IF you can do that you basically belong in plat and higher because even here player are unable to control waves effeciently and its all you need to climb. Everything else comes with playtime such as mechanics and gameknowledge.

- build your champpool around early-midgame champions that can use their superiority of farm to their advantage and snowball in the midgame.

Possible champpool:Garen,Renekton,elise,xinzhao,annie,morgana,corki,graves

All of these champions really do scale into midgame and have huge powerspikes in the midgame. They are not that great in lategame but usually you wanna snowball from lane either by kills or farm so thats fine. Dont play for lategame if you wanna climb thats just dumb because anything can happen jungler can camp you or your support can be shit.Plus with these 8 champs you have covered any role effectively with good champs"
"I assume, as long as the timer resets when the other team gets a ghost dragon, it is indeed possible. Depending on how fucked up the coding is, one morde might actually be able to get more that one dragon."
"Based on my empirical evidence of knowing at least a couple dozen people through the years who've claimed they didn't need deodorant, soap, and/or shampoo because they didn't smell, etc, my best guess is that 99.44% of people who say they don't smell, in fact could knock a buzzard off a corpse. "
"Really? I didn't like it as much. It just seems really......vanilla. The different hero's just seem almost too balanced, where you never really get an advantage. You can't just get really fed and start snowballing. I didn't hate the game, but after playing about 100 games, I just found myself really bored. "

"His skill set makes for a very diverse hero in terms of item builds, BoTs and Rapiers work because of that but so does Necrobook, dagon, E-Blade and every other active item you can think of(not refresher).

Apparently this is already a thing called twincharging. Some of the Volkswagen 1.4L TSI engines are twincharged. Disadvantage seems to be that these are expensive to make and too complex to maintain. Twin turbo and twin scroll turbo systems seem to do a similar job while keeping the system less complex.
"1) There is no such thing as porn addiction. It's a fable created by religion. It's not a recognized medical condition and not supported by any literature. 

2) It's likely when your bf masturbates he uses the death grip and essentially has desensitized his penis. No vagina is going to feel like a hand, that's life. He needs to stop using the death grip and masturbating until he is raw. 

3) Your bf has some MAJOR issues he needs to work out in therapy. He is not likely in a place where he should really be in a relationship right now. Get him to therapy to deal with his past and present. That's the only way he as a person will ever get past this and have a fulfilling life. "

""" Hamill noted that his son Nathan helped keep him abreast of new developments in Star Wars fandom. “He’ll say, ‘Oh my god, Dad, Greedo shoots first now!’ I’ll say, ‘Wait, wait, wait. Let’s put this in perspective: Who cares?’” That led Hamill into a full-throated defense of the Star Wars prequels: “Jar Jar was supposed to be irritating! He’s irritating to the other characters in the movie!” He concluded by arguing that Lucas had earned the right to make Star Wars films in the manner he wanted. “Those aren’t sorta the movies he wanted them to be, they’re exactly the movies they wanted to make,” said Hamill. “And I’m not gonna criticize them at all.” ""

"During the war, ""blackout"" conditions were to be kept by law as a defense against enemy planes being able to navigate by our city lights.  No lights showing outside the house from inside, heavy curtains in place on every window, everyone indoors in many cases.  Remember seeing any of the old wartime Bugs Bunny cartoons?  A voice yelling offscreen ""PUT OUT THAT LIGHT!"".  Wardens enforcing the blackout.

Well, what are you going to do for fun when you're stuck inside and all the curtains are drawn?  Or rather, who?"
I said often not never. It differs by jurisdiction.

From an FPL and fan perspective, I'm hoping that Pedro becomes locked in at RW for Chelsea with Oscar and Willian competing for the CAM spot, but that remains to be seen. 

I agree with you about upgrading Gomis. I'd rather have Benteke or Lukaku, but I'm not sure the potential gains there would be worth what I'd have to give up for that 1m elsewhere. Do you see a good place to scrape together a few pounds?"

This is the deck I was using. I honestly think it would be viable in a different meta. Paladins are about 75% of my faceups though and they just crap on it even with 2 oozes and whirlwind teched in. It really holds true to its name though and I've had a lot of fun playing it.

"I bought my first real bike, 09 GS500 off a guy who just had it posted as ""Suzuki 500"" and waaayyyy below market value, no pictures, didn't know anything about the bike. Turns out it was his wife's bike, he really didn't know anything about it.... it was in great shape, low miles, and he just wanted to pay off the loan so hence the low asking price. I got a stupid good deal out of it. Anyways, the lesson here is the old quote, Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence.

"I think the message is that the neighborhood is not safe for people to display the confederate battle flag. The people admitted he got the beating for the flag, not the accident. Guy is a dick. Regardless of the accident he is antagonizing a community. Can't play dumb because someone had already taken one of his flags and burned it... He replaced it and continues his charades. I have a feeling there were several people just waiting for any chance to get him. People are so fucking concerned with their individual rights that they treat others inhumanely, here it was on both sides. He has the right to display his retard flag and they have the right to live happily without some asshat waiving a flag which belittles them. "
"As a funny followup today, I was mistaken - I didn't have an opening shift with my manageress - but her, the head driver, and the guy who'll soon be shift runner had a meeting with the managers/higher-ups from the other stores the franchise owner owns, and apparently the conclusion was that he doesn't know how to run a business, and should be ignored when not talking directly to you.

My manageress also recommended some places I could apply to to get out of the store."
"Feedback on my new Track please!!! 



Hey, this is my latest song. I have been producing for a few months andI have a few things I noticed (I set deadlines for myself to try to get out a lot of songs and practice a lot) 1. The bass in the middle might sound a bit off (but it was on key) should I have moved the key or keep it on key? 2. It doesn't really follow a flow (the aim was some form of electro house) 3. On my laptop speakers, the kick sounds soft... but on my headphones (which I mix on) it sounds good... why? I tried to master a bit better on this one so its more clear and balanced! Also, I cant really get monitors since im in school.... I dont think the roommates would enjoy that... but if I really should, what are a good pair of monitors that wont make me eat ramen for the rest of my life... https://soundcloud.com/acolomusic/when-i-am-with-original-mix"

"1) Yay! Someone to argue with about the technicalities of the English language!

2) What I was pointing out was that immigrating is entering a foreign country, and emigrating is leaving your own. When you said:

&gt;TO another country

that is the definition of immigrating. When you said:

&gt; from your own

that is emigration. So I was just saying that your definition of immigration defined both.

HOWEVER, seeing as you emphasized ""to,"" therefore putting emphasis on the entering-a-country part, I don't have a real problem with your definition."

"""I am."" Alan Tarly said, anger writ clear on his features. He looked up at the man who had spoken, *Iron Born*, and that anger only seemed to deepen. ""You truly do not know me?"" Alan asked, curious as to what rock this seal-lover had been hiding under. It was a very rare thing that the Master of War, and 'Hero of the Brand', went unrecognized. 

Though it was not an, altogether, unwelcome one. Being recognized and praised for something you had done in your youth grew tiresome after a time, most especially when your success could easily have gone quite differently. Had Arrec of the Burning Brand been more pragmatic in his fighting style, the name 'Alan Tarly' would have been lost to history. 

""And you, are you not green? I have fought in the wars for my liege, can you say the same?"" He asked the man. "
"Hmmm. I'm thinking of those shotgun skeet/trap ranges where they have a microphone which launches the clay pigeon when you yell ""pull!"" (Or any similar sharp sounding vocalization).

"You could easily limit structure placement based on a points system. x amount of points are available and x amount of points will be used for placement. Just need to figure equations to allow only placement of 1 foundation/tamper/large/small structure.

"He looks seriously wiped out. Guess they're teaching him for real!

"It's not about color, it's about crookedness. I'm neither American, nor British, but I have to admit, I've seen a lot of Brits with crooked teeth. On the other hand, this might just be an example of a self-reinforcing bias. "
"I agree with:

* Living Roots - I don't think they'll be top 1, but they are very useful and versatile to fit into many decks. This is generally a sign for a quality card.

* Darnassus Aspirant - the chance on getting a turn 3 shredder/yeti just is too real to ignore it, and even if it gets removed it's still three health. Also gives Druid more staying power against aggressive decks.

* Wyrmrest Agent - hilariously good card for Dragon Priest, which really became viable through cards like this.

I am split on:

* Justicar Trueheart - Maybe not the highest ranking but certainly viable to some extend. Interesting card in control. Unless there will be decks specifically built around it, I'd guess it will only come about as often as Black Knight though.

* Polymorph: Boar - this might be a card where we think ""oh it has so many cool combo and deckbuilding opportunites"" but that is ultimately just not focussed enough to enable one particular strategy. I see it the best in some sort of tempo mage where it can help eliminate strong taunts or deliver some burst, but at the same time tempo mage seems weak in the current meta.

* Murloc Knight - it's a really cool card if it works out. But will we see decks that Murlock Knight actually fits in? Not sure yet. It might fall by the wayside.


I disagree with:

* Elemental Destruction. A really potent removal, yes, but the sacrifice is severe. I think Shamans will work around maintaing a board presence rather than full board wipes. This is the traditional Shaman strategy, this is what cards like Totem Golem reinforce, and what the new totem combo cards truly rely on. I would mostly see it as part of combo decks. Maybe as part of a resurgence of Double-Doomhammer Faceshaman.

* Refreshment Vendor. I think this is a generally heavily overrated card. TGT brought a lot of great control cards already that make survival against aggro much easier, that it is not necessary to rely on a four mana with slight heal. If Senjin Shieldmasta wasn't a popular card, neither will this one be.

* Gormok the Impaler. The condition is too difficult to meet. Right now it mostly plays out as a win-harder card. I find this another generally overrated card. And in this weeks Archon Team League it didn't have a good impact either.

* Enter the Coliseum. It's not great against control decks and still leaves the biggest threats up in zoo decks. It will be reliable on combo with cards like Owl, BGH, Peacekeeper, which is devastating for a 6 mana card. The next comparable card Brawl always comes with the hope of leaving weak enemies alive (nerubian eggs or haunted creepers for example) or giving you immediate board control. For Paladin I just don't see it beating equality/consecrate/wild pyro combos, which come at cheaper mana costs and are way easier to combo."

"Texas is that cool uncle that your parents don't like you hanging out with unsupervised because he always teaches you how to do cool stuff like burning things with magnifying glasses, or buying fireworks for you in October. "
The biggest reason I have a problem with this bull theory is that it implies that centaurs of antiquity are the exact same type of creatures that are in a world that has teenage and prepubescent witches and wizards attending high school together.
"I've used Manely Long Hair products for my arab. (manelylonghair.com) Mostly I just use the polisher/conditioner. I picked it up at our recent Equine Affaire and it's worked wonders on her really fine mane. "

"Guinea pigs *are* just giant hamsters, but hamsters aren't a familiar English animal, so you can't call them guinea hamsters, that defeats the purpose of giving them a name that just means ""foreign version of a thing we have at home."""
"I got downvoted to shit while trying to have a discussion in good faith about the Puppies last night. Also relentlessly mocked.

Also one guy defended having sex with people too drunk to consent, but that's just him I think."
"Yes, either would be a better choice than what is on the LP60. If I were choosing, I would go with the OM5E. I like the sound of it better and it has some nice upgrade options for the future. You can use any stylus in the Super OM line (OM10, OM20, OM30, OM40) with the OM5e."
"So you're not searching for friendships then. . . I don't get it.  You're just cynical and assume everyone else is the same way?
I mean it makes sense to dump a friend where the relationship is not mutually beneficial (so you're the one offering all the support and getting nothing back).  But what are you defining as ""useful""?"
"Are you autistic? It's called a generalization. Sure, there are probably some self-hating black people on the interwebs, but as a rule it's safe to discount anyone who claims to be black and immediately goes on to spout racist bullshit. Or, you know, you can just keep going around believing everyone online is exactly who they claim to be. Whatever floats your boat. "
"Italy. Nice middling power with a strong ally so someone has your back if you screw up too bad. Nice clear goal as well, dominating the Mediterranean, plenty of small guys in the balkans to warm up on before you take on any real powers.

You're also pretty much guaranteed to do better than the Italians did historically, even as a complete noob, so you don't feel bad about when you screw up, because hey, at least you took Greece without needing papa Germany to help you out."
"Love your posts.  Agree that the Nazi's were evil, and had horendous plans.  But to be factual, a lot of lot of the destruction was in part, because of the scorched earth policy of the Soviets, even at the expense of their citizens.  There is room for both sides to be evil."
"Yeah, the difference here I am pointing out is that when we use elastic IRL, we can't make it expand and contract like muscle tissue (it just stretches and collapses based on external forces), but in video games that is generally how elastics work. Using enough elastic in GMOD, for example, you can resolve those issues with a walking robot's balance by having the elastic act like muscle tissue instead of using single-pivot joints. It gives the machine the same kind of control a human has in keeping their balance when constructed right.

This is also how we could resolve the issues IRL, mind you; if we could create artificial muscles, we could make realistic legs (as well as better hands). Hydraulics, pistons, hinges, etc are just not precise enough to have all the constant small movements a human uses to keep upright. But muscles would."
"Agreed, This is just a ploy for fatty fee fees to be told he's special and he's gonna make it. Face it dude you fucked up, at this point go on a liquid diet, consult a bariatric specialist because it's far beyond what a fucking gym membership can do for you. 700 lbs is fucking massive."
"It's pretty ridiculous, and is just as bad as some of the right wing denier stuff out there. They're trying to equate extreme weather to climate change, and are angry with Mass because he understands it's much more complicated than that.

"HAHAHA holy shit.  I assumed nothing but what you looked like by your absurd comment and then replied in-kind.

I didn't hit you with any more smack than you used to spewing, son. Step into this ring, you gonna get wrecked."
"I play it on a somewhat regular basis. There's a good crew called [CMW](http://www.cmwgaming.com/index.html) that has some dedicated servers that are usually full (64 people). Their TeamSpeak is spotty, but when it's lively it's a great group."
"What would you rather have, someone who's shooting 33% from the three point line or someone who's shooting 70 to 80% under the basket. Because that's what Shaq would do against a 6'7"" player. And I would take a dominant big man as a defender over a Draymond Green type player any day of the week for clogging the paint and the extra rebounding that you get"
"I totally understand. People would think you're ""bitter"" or a ""Grinch"" when you want a calm birthday / holiday. Every year during the days before my birthday party, moms gets more annoying with her shit for no reason.

Just this week, she has made me lose a job opportunity (because it ""was beneath me"", it was ""menial"", ""for poor people"", etc.), has sticked her tongue out at me after rattling me to my dad because I hadn't made my bed, and told my uncle's wife (in front of me): ""She doesn't have the same level of maturity I had when I was her age because I got married at her age"" and ""Just by looking at her, I know she's not emotionally ready for marriage"" (when she is the only adult I know that throws tantrums)... [CUE CYNICAL MOCKING LAUGHTER] And this is only the prelude for the birthday party... :/

Then she'll probably tell me I'm turning 25 and have no job, couldn't finish uni due to lack of money, have anxiety and tics, have no boyfriend, I'm single, have no kids, I'm a tomboy, I need to forget about my ""childish"" hobbies to be the ""proper lady"" I'm supposed to be, smother me with hugs in front of the rest of family, frown when someone gives me a present related to my likes (i.e: not proper for ""ladies"" because it's ""childish"", ""boyish"", and for ""geeky antisocial losers""), etc, etc, etc.

Or the time she viciously insulted everyone at sight while screaming at the top of her lungs, stomping, pouting, laughing manically, etc... to the point everyone (even the people who weren't the target of her rage) left in tears. Best Christmas dinner ever."
"This is actually our exact current issue and I wouldn't mind your two cents if possible. We have a huge amount of condensation in our unit. We did our best to keep the windows dry, keeping fans on all day etc etc but we both work and it's hard (and unreasonable) to be maintaining it all day. So water would literally flow down the windows over the winter. The damage to the flooring, baseboards, windows was quite severe. There is actually mold growth along the baseboards as well. The builder refuses to even look at it let alone fix it (since it's likely a building issue) and now the landlord wants us to pay for it. We submitted a T6 application for the landlord to fix the floors and now he is coming back with the T2 to increase the rent by about 10%. We have a scheduled pre-conference meeting with the LTB in a few weeks. Do you have any advice for meeting with the LTB? We have a ton of email/picture evidence going back to last year with us trying to get the landlord to do something about it to no avail. This is really unfortunate for us because we LOVE our location, the layout/style of the unit and the building amenities. We have been good tenants, we make sure the place stays clean and maintained from our end and we always pay our rent, no exceptions"
It will bring more players back then it will drag away from the main game. NTM If you only have 1 outfit battle at a time it will only take 48 players away from the main game. This game needs end game content. Daybreaks knows it they were working on a game mode called conquest which would pull people from the main game anyway.
"IMO that is the major part of the problem, and the thing that makes this patch the least fun patch I've personally experienced. Not being able to ban out the broken champs forces them to be picked, either by ppl riding the stomp train or people not wanting get stomped by them. This makes it so some many of the same champs are picked every game depending on how the bans play out. Being force to play this small pool of champs just so you dont have to play against them is BS. Takes away from playing the game how you want. There have always been champs like that, but right now theres too many and Riot has completely forced a specific playstyle which is ironic. The games I've played in the last few days have been the least fun and least diverse of any time I can remember. 

First patch ever to make me want to take a break form the game"
"Tulo slashed .300/.348/.471 in Colarado this season and he is slashing .225/.325/.353 since coming to Toronto.

Winning games doesn't necessarily mean there are not things going on within those games that could be improved.

They damn well want to make sure they get the most out of Tulo, so if they can do something to get him back on track, I'm sure they would explore that."
"&gt; the Boltons would have ALL the justification and reason in the world to end the watch (without any difficulty too) by simply walking into Castle Black and flaying everyone.

Is there a scenario where this can be avoided? Either Ramsay marches north and demands his reek and bride, then flays everyone, or Jon marches south to die and then Ramsay marches north and flays everyone."
"My money is on traitor, or at least reluctant collaborator. She was always intrigued and excited by the aliens, almost suspiciously so. Given the ""peaceful collaboration"" that was established, I think Vahlen would be ecstatic at the chance to get access to alien research labs."
"I would, but I already have a costume for this year, and surely no one wants me to steal Mr. Marsters' clothes - so rude. But I trust that soon my inbox will resemble the dealer's hall on Saturday, rather than the wasteland it becomes Monday afternoon. That's *exactly* how this works. "
"It'll still be rendered though, overwise you'd have massive stutters when moving the camera and you'd be able to see what isn't rendered as it can't predict where or when you're going to rotate the camera."
"Yea, pretty much.  The biggest issue is the roll's complexity, but it also opens doors for a lot of ways to manipulate the roll.  And it'd be hard to calculate reasonably across the board what the effects would be: is another d6 a better pay off than increasing a d8 to a d10?"
"The Xeku's eye wandered left. Then right. Left. Then right. Alicia's eyes narrowed as she slowly moved out into the open, machine gun and beam smart rifle ready. The dust was thick and dark, smitten with chunks of rubble and ember. ""Where are you hiding.."", she hissed to herself as the Titans suit's elongated feet slammed down against the ruined tarmac. She supposed that this suit's designation of 'Hunter' was right on the mark- but now Alicia had lost her target. Swiftly, the suit jetted itself backwards against a red brick wall and held out it's dual arms in both direction. She couldn't tell where her opponent would come from.. but she could be as ready as possible.

There is no physical beauty in that. There is no beauty in the gaunt face and raspy voice of an old woman dying of lung cancer. There is sadness. She was not beautiful. And that is fucking okay."

"&gt;You guys are pathetic.

Coming on a little strong there bro. Obviously every team deals with injuries, and no body said either team ""would have one so many more games"" I did say it would not be unreasonable to think that 2 more wins was within the realm of possibility. I do also think that being on your 5th string anywhere is pretty damn brutal, again, yes injuries happen to every team, but they are usually spread out across multiple positions, 5 at one position is pretty damn brutal.

You have private schools, two universities, colleges and a fascinating history. 
Yes the traffic sucks, it gets cold in the winter and the bugs are bad, but that's life

"Did you know you can buy a 2014 Sonata with 40k miles for 13k? 

You can do that. I have one for sale at my dealership right now.  

A 2015 Sonata ranges from 21k to 30k~. Lets say it's 25k for ease.  Now if the two were side by side which would you pick.  Where you go from there determines your financing options.  0% interest is awesome, but you still have to make a payment of $320 for 6 years and put 2k down. 

Say you bought a 13k car, financed 13k for 3.5 years at 2.9% interest and your payment would be 325/mo and you would pay 686 in interest.

 I've unfortunately yet to read any reviews regarding the Double Nude linked to, or the non-realistic version that has been out longer, the Olga. So I've no idea how well it really works. But I can make some educated guesses...

First of all, the woman will absolutely need a harness to keep this in her. Her side is not even designed in a bulbous shape such that even for woman on woman strap on sex it probably wouldn't stay in, let alone pegging since the anus is typically stronger than vaginal muscles. I'd guess this might work well for women who don't want a large insertion on their end and vibration is not important or necessary to them receiving pleasure. 

If you are in the USA, the only place I know you can find them online to buy would be:

"&gt;I was at the Governor's Cup game last year and there were thousands of empty seats and tons of UK fans. This expansion pretty much has everything to do with increasing capacity past that of Commonwealth Stadium.

I was with you until you said this.  It has absolutely nothing to do with UK and to think that is just silly.  It has everything to do with building more luxury boxes and suites which are sold by season and bring in more money than whole sections of standard seating.

This expansion has always been planned...PJCS was built specifically to be able to be expanded up to 80,000 if and when the demand ever rose to that level.  We just didnt know when exactly enclosing the bowl would be announced.  "

I keep it in my bag with my multimeter, and I always wonder if a cop would try and call it a gravity knife. That being said I know there's no way to flick that blade out, and between the screwdriver, wirecutter \ pliers and screwdrivers, its the perfect tool for me to open junction boxes and panel covers, and also hopefully avoid this nonsense. 


I'd honestly be curious to see a cop justify giving me a problem on this, after producing my business card and other tools.


Another good knife I have that I recommend to a NY'er is an opinel folder, which has a twisting ring that is used to lock the blade open or closed, so there's no way to open it without twisting the ring first. That's my lunch knife lol. Never know when you might have to slice a baguette and some cheese. They're fantastic.

"Here's a fun fact: When Apple originally released iTunes and the first iPod, people were complaining that the shuffle feature was playing the same songs over and over again. As it turns out, this is what happened when ""Shuffle"" was truly random, so Apple was forced to make their Shuffle feature LESS random by adding code that prevented songs from playing more than once and giving the illusion of true randomness."
"&gt;There are certain truths that are self evident, like all people are created equal. 

Define ""equal"". Because I've yet to see an instrumental, meaningful definition of the word for which the sentence, ""All people are equal at birth"" is true. It's simply not the case. What most people seem to mean with the phrase is ""all people *should be* equal"" - which is a laudable sentiment for some of the commonly-used definitions (such as equality before the law), but wishing something doesn't make it real.

"Honestly, best way to stay in bronze: act like each and every ranked game is life-or-death and that failing one means you'll be stuck in bronze forever. It is well known that it only takes 2-3 wins to get to challenger, so losing a few games is the worst thing that could happen.

In fact, don't even play ranked, losing a ranked game is so bad that you might as well not even play. Studies have shown that the fastest way to climb is to wait until the next season and try to get as high as you can in your placements.

EDIT: another thing- never pay attention to your minimap or ward your lane. If another lane roams your teammate will ping an AFK and if they don't then the game is over.

EDIT 2: it's helpful to be spread out over the map, grouping is bad, ""safety in numbers"" is a noob concept and not worthy of your challenger skillz. Part of this is dragging out laning phase for as long as possible. You generally want to keep CSing in lane for at least the first 30-40 minutes of a game. Even if the enemy has grouped in 5 and is pushing down your inhib, if it isn't your lane, it isn't your problem."

In the US, at least, many people file patent applications without actual prototypes.

This is because most physical objects can be adequately verified on paper or with CAD.

&gt;you want to have a patentability search run to make sure your idea hasn't been patented before

A patentability search does not determine if something has been patented before.  It determines if an idea was already publicly disclosed.  As you know, what is patented is set out in the claims of a patent.  When doing a patentability search you do not need to look at the claims of the patent.

"&gt; So you admit that it's not that ridiculous to point out the fact that the shooter is being given significantly less attention than the other well known shootings for the past couple years.

The problem was with the other assertion - that he's getting less attention than other well-known shooters have in recent years *because he was black*, and his victims were white, rather than the other way around.

As though Dylan Roof was only regarded as ""more newsworthy"" *because he killed black people*, like killing white people just isn't as big a deal to CNN or its audience.

That's absurd, and incredibly offensive, and *really* lazy. Think it through:

Dylan Roof was killing black people *because they were black*. The media focused on him because here was a living, breathing race warrior, with a manifesto and a *whole* lot of hate in his heart. America is riveted by this because it's an extra special kind of horrifying, and because we know there must be more like him, and we wonder if they're organized... it's just a huge, scary issue of national concern, on many levels.

*This* shooting was only newsworthy *at all* because it was televised. The shooter doesn't get special attention because there's nothing notable about the shooter. He was a disgruntled former employee with a vendetta. Dylan Roof wanted to kill black people. Flanagan left some racist words behind, but that wasn't his thing. He didn't want to kill white people, he wanted to kill *these people*.

*That's* why the shooter isn't getting nearly as much attention as other well-known shootings. Other well-known shootings are well-known for a particular reason. Sadly, America's homicide rate is pretty high, and the only thing that distinguishes *this* shooting from ""any given shooting"" (I can't believe that's an applicable phrase) is the film equipment."

The student loan is 3.75 apr and is down to $1765. The personal loan is actually a loan from a family member and is at no interest. It was a deal struck in college because my parents couldn't offer me much help financially and my uncle didn't want me to smother in debt and interest. I could borrow up to 10k per year as long as I paid 1% of what I owed while I was in school. Ended up borrowing just over 20k for 4 years on top of 20k in real student loans.

"*wohnen* is closely related to *die Wohnung* (the flat, the apartment), so it refers to your residency. *leben* on the other hand is related to the noun *das Leben* (the life), so it's a more broad term.

Generally, every time you're talking about *where* specifically you live (in San Diego, in a house), you can use either of them. But if it's about *how* you live, then ""wohnen"" doesn't make any sense and you have to use ""leben"".

*Ich lebe gesund.* - I live healthily / I have a healthy lifestyle.  
*Ich lebe noch.* - I'm still alive.  
in both cases ""wohnen"" wouldn't make any sense.

"/u/Mattiewagg and I had a similar idea to a starting option for ASLAL. It was a little extensive, but in summary it was going to be an option where you seem to have amnesia when waking up in the ASLAL cell. You are asked by the statue what you last remember, but you can't recall anything. You're response option is something along the lines of ""The last thing I can remember is from when I was just a kid.""

It would initiate an interactive ""memory"" that you play as using a custom child race, this race (and possibly the storyline) will be dependent on which race you chose as a starting character. It would most likely be a smaller worldspace with a few quests, something similar to Fable II's beginning. The end result will explain how you ended up in the cell due to events that take place during the last quest.

"I loved going to school as a kid. You sit down with 25 other kids, and your teacher guides you through some stuff that neither you nor your classmates ever knew before. When class is over, all 25 people walk out the door more informed than they were 50 minutes before. Now, as an adult, I've had to learn enough about my subject so that I could provide that experience to others. It's been a blast. Of course it never works perfectly--someone in the group will lose attention, or not care, or be too sick/injured/depressed to function that day. But it works for the majority of the students for the majority of the time, and I love being part of it."
"Dude what's worse?  Marussia?  Pick your choice between three teams that will be struggling next year in terms of the average field pace: HAAS, McLaren, or Marussia.  Marussia is out and HAAS is loaded, has plenty of decent drivers who just want to be back in f1, has a wind tunnel, a stellar record in motorsports, he is an engineer and is surrounded by tens of other who are as well.  It can't get much worse than McLaren and Marussia...so idk why and in what world I would choose McLaren, when Haas has been working on a car for two years *and* is coming in with Ferrari motors after plenty of help from Ferrari itself.  McLaren is a good choice, if you're an established driver like button and Alonso.  People are well aware they're great.  But if you're looking at being in f1 for more than a season as a driver...marussia and McLaren are not places to go. McLaren will have a shit car and can the slowest driver.  Marussia could go under at any breath during the day.  Haas is in for the long haul and has the money to do so himself.  Even without sponsors.  If I wanted to break back into or enter f1 with the hopes of staying...not sure why Haas wouldn't be the place to go.  Everyone has just been shrugging their shoulders over McLaren's pace for years now and marussia belongs in gp2/is lucky to see tomorrow.  Look at their lap times and speed traps.

McLaren is just a name right now.  Which sucks.  Honestly.  They have a heritage and shit, but they've been in the gutter for years. A gutter full of money with nothing decent coming out.  The only people who think *anyone* would be enticed to go to McLaren are people holding onto hope like grim death. I like McLaren...but they've just turned into a solid back marker that ends up in the top ten when everyone else has a bad day.  No matter who they are.  A long chain of poor decisions m8y.

People regard McLaren highly because of who they were...not who they are and that is indisputable."

"I do both. Kindle has an awesome feature with Audible where your reading spot is synced between them. So ill read when im at home but I walk to work so ill listen to the audiobook then. And usually if you buy the Kindle book first the audiobook ""upgrade"" is only a few dollars more. "
"I used to be super shy too. I had no friends in high school. But I got so sick of it, so I found the strength in me to put myself out there. The hardest part is just convincing yourself that you don't care what anyone thinks. That was my problem. I cared so much that I just tried to exist as little as possible. But that's not living. You just gotta do you and you'll be so much happier :) I realize people really don't care. What you think may be super awkward, people aren't going to think much of it. Start with small steps, like smiling at people in passing. And then you can try saying hi to people in your classes. It's all about having the right mentality. If you think you screwed up, or you did something really awkward, stop right there, it's okay, they're not going to remember it tomorrow. Try not to care about what others think about you. It's really not a big deal. No one's analyzing and remembering your every move. Observe how other people interact and learn. Clubs are a great place to make friends because you're all there for a common interest so you don't have to worry about common ground. It's a fun environment so just let go and be yourself :)

EDIT: I'll be living in an apartment and I plan on going door to door handing out baked goods and introducing myself to my neighbors. Will I have awkward interactions? Probably. Will I get weird looks? Maybe. But do I care? No, because someone is guaranteed to love baked goods, I'll get smiles out of people, and I might make a few new friends."

"I don't disagree with you man. Sure there is an element of truth and inspiration that has led to this character called ""The Weeknd"".

I'm not denying he wasn't depressed or doing drugs like mad (I think he did self-harm if I remember correctly), but it has served as inspiration for his music, guided deeply by his producers. It worked well, and he stuck with it. 

He is an entertainer after all, and he acknowledges that his job is to entertain us (see the letter to the fans that he wrote). 

He loves movies -- he loves to tell stories. I think pre-BBTM The Weeknd was a story authored by Abel and co., with The Weeknd as protagonist. BBTM is probably his most truthful, autobiographic body of work yet. 

But hey, I don't wanna pretend I know him personally and I could be very wrong. As DJ Akademiks said, when the credits start rolling in a film, you know the actor is just an actor. With music it is more ambiguous. "

"that's fair, overton window could be a thing though.

in other fairness, i've only seen corbyn support from people i quite like, and stuff against him from people i...like less, in the real world - i confess i don't spend much time on twitter or indeed reddit.
worth mentioning that it's worth kendall's time to reply well to the most unpleasant of corbyn supporters, but that's a weak argument.

regarding your comment on the other thread, yeah, i have to admit. but if i can be frank, ""associations"" with anti-semites and holocaust deniers is just bollocks. that word ""friends"" in the notorious (was it hezbolla?) meeting was obviously an attempt to broker bi-partisan support within a very divided audience, and standing on a common platform you otherwise despise in support of a greater good is more admirable i think than refusing to do so. fuel to the fire, yes, but stuff like this is just making it worse

"I'm a big fan of winter.
There's no mosquitos, so being outside is awesome. It's made even more awesome when the landscape is covered in white. Also I tend to sweat a lot in summer, and that doesn't happen much in the winter, at least not when it would be an inconvenience. 
There's less crowds because some people drive cars that can't handle the snow, and some people can't tolerate the cold. 
Winter-appropriate clothes are the cutest.
I love the sting on your face when it's bitterly cold and windy outside, and the relief you feel when you get back indoors.
The feeling of having a drink of tea (or hot chocolate) after being cold outside is heavenly. 
Doggies tend to like the snow, and the ones that can't handle it too well get to dress up in cute sweaters.
I'm not religious but I like Christmas, people get so festive.
Oh, and snow days are awesome."

"I don't remember saying that, I blame the booze. I think what I meant was that a deficit is not a mortal sin and spending can bolster an economy. On a provincial level that can become quite a burden, but on the national level quite a bit less so due to the differences in interest rates charged. 


anyways

I don't see how playing the reasonable adult in the room is a damming offense. All Trudeau is saying is that the other parties are promising the impossible with tax cuts, spending increases, and balanced budgets; he's just pointing out deficits are not cancer.

"Fantastic call on the hard hat -- I somehow missed that the first time in both the close-up and far-away glimpses we get of it. 

I assumed civil engineer/architect based on the pictures of buildings everywhere and the general ""put-togetherness"" of the space. I suppose OP could be employed in petrochem but have a background/passion for civil or architecture. That's where the money is, and this guy seems to be living like a youngish adult with enough income for nice things.

You didn't guess at geographic location, but trees/central air/lack of baseboard heating/architectural style are suggesting gulf coast to me (which informs my petrochem guess), probably Houston given the Texaco and what I think might be a Texas state seal decorations, although the architectural style is much more reminiscent of NOLA or an ""older"" southern city.

I can't really pin ethnicity with an acceptable degree of certainty. I would have said Chinese given the hanging by the door, but the Hindu statue and some of the books give me much pause in that regard. Londonistan would have made me think British Indian with a bug for travel, but next to some of the other books it looks like a college reading list. Huh. Does learning about terrorism make petrochem more or less likely? So hard to guess ethnicity for me... is that a hardbound copy of ""Lamb""? That may date OP closer to early 30's than 35+. He also has some books there that look a lot like law casebooks. That's interesting. Is that bag by the door military? I wish I had more to work with here. I think my basic knowledge is a little light for me to draw conclusions based on that bag combined with some other items, but it probably means something."

"Don't be delusional. Nobody cares that you don't play ""the way you're supposed to"". You're being down voted because you're explaining you choices with completely factually incorrect information. You're just plain wrong about it. If you had said, ""I realize full clearing gives me NO MORE DB than closing at RG, and the only difference is that I get LESS xp, gold, keys, and blood shards, yet I still choose to do it for no reason other than I want to"", you would not be down voted harshly. Instead, you defend your (poor, by your own logic) choice with incorrect information, and your attitude is belligerent, defensive, and you're acting like a martyr while blaming everyone in the sub. I can't imagine why you'd be surprised. "
"If your KDA and farming is good the missing piece may be you are not taking enough risks that will help your team push towers to ultimately win the game.  Of course this is always a general problem in ranked since it's hard to coordinate random people to push together at lower MMRs, but if you lead the charge your team may follow.  If you get ahead with Ember you can get super aggressive and ult in and kill someone before they can do anything about it, and hopefully then your team follows up to grab an objective afterwards.  Ember also is a good split pusher because he can get away instantly, so it's possible for you to get towers down low yourself when the opponent is distracted and get away scot free.  As a final note if you get way ahead but just can't quite have the impact you want in fights, there's no shame in getting a BKB and then just manfighting while waiting for your skills to come off CD after you jump into a team fight- this will guarantee you have more impact in that fight than if you would have been forced to sort of skirt the outside otherwise."

"Yes. If Lars and Ronaldo were able to get some sort of flashback so can Jasper, except she's way more badass and has undeniably been through a lot since she got dragged to the bottom of the ocean by Lapis so we'll get more out of her. 

How are they gonna make her go through all that suffering and then just kill her afterwards? Does she deserve it THAT bad? All she's really done is fight Garnet, but so have Lapis and Peridot (well, more the Crystal Gems than Garnet).

Think about all the info we could get out of her from the HW perspective of the war. She was on the front lines and made it sound as if she actually fought against Rose herself. None of us know what she's been doing since the wars either. "
"I can confirm it! I was one of the reviewers invited to the Konami event where we got to play full retail copies of The Phantom Pain for four days.

You don't get penalized for kills but keep in mind that you can't Fulton a corpse. If you knock out a guard, you can get rid of his body easily by ballooning him out of there. Can't do that with dead guys.

Killing will also forfeit your chance of earning a Perfect Stealth bonus."

"I eased into it over a few years. I started out by just cutting down on fries, chips, and stuff like that. It took me about 3 years to completely cut out junk food. I would have cut it out faster but it's a bit harder when you start as a 6th grader. Once I hit high school I ate zero junk. The key is finding food you enjoy and just not even buying the junk food to begin with. Now I have pretty much zero cravings for junk food except sometimes I'll have a craving for ice cream. After a while if eating healthy, junk food just sounds gross most of the time. I tried having a cheat meal one time and just felt sick afterwards. If you have meals planned out and always available, eating healthy is super easy. "

"I top went 6th at my FNM last week (my store does Modern on Friday because the Standard scene at a near by shop is WAY too large) using the version of the deck by Gavin Verhey with the addition of Ensnaring Bridge's replacing Victim of Night. No Liliana and I still walked away with my packs and a Serum Visions. 

I will say Delirium Skeins helped a lot in the 3 drop slot it brought back 2 games where my opponent was getting card advantage and Smallpox/Blackmail combo was the deciding factor for most of my games.

The Raven's Crime + Dakmor Salvage combo in that deck helped me win against a burn opponent that would have just smoked me otherwise.

"Spoilers, he says you should try wardens.  Irony.jpg

So for my jumpers which are around 100' max, the thing I focus on most is really good and quick weight transfer.  Don't jump because you have to, jump because the momentum from your weight shift *makes* you.  I also change styles from a push(ish) putt to more of a spush kinda like Rico style, this makes my release a bit different though and I have to aim a little more left than normal.  Hope that helps maybe?"

"I don't get it at all because it has the same coverage area as the existing metro. It's just siphoning off paying customers from the public infrastructure.

"I was hoping that we would stick with /r/communismworldwide being our endorsed sub. Dont know when that ended either. This seems like an endorsement of /r/socialism, which has a growing number of liberals, socdems, and market socialists. Perfect targets for this sub to belittle. Linking to outside subs just ends up with that sub brigading us. Text posts help a little bit, but not much when most centre left subs with liberal garbage would look for us anyways. Ive seen it happen many times.

All this rule does is limit the ability of /r/socialism regulars using this sub to find the liberal garbage and use it to agitate against it. 

I was hoping that you, as a /r/socialism mod, would argue in our favor towards the other mods. Really this sub helped /r/socialism filter the garbage, as seen by the influx of liberals lately. /r/socialism wont ban them just for supporting socdem so downvoting them all and commenting on why they are wrong is what keeps the sub clean of liberal garbage. Unlike Communismworldwide where liberalism is banned. And even if it is small now, this sub would grow it, if it endorsed it. 

Seems like the mod spot is more important for you."
"I'm planning on moving to the uk. I've been playing a few years in NZ, 25 Y/O. Is it easy to get a gun?

They might not be educated in airsoft laws."
"You know why we keep coming back to this idea (other than just the fact that they're three talented, young, good wrestlers)? There is one thing that the members of the Shield have in the way they're booked and announced that almost no-one else on the roster does. 

Continuity.

They have one interconnected story since their debut that is still consistently referenced, and it makes the characters so much more interesting and rich. If they would do this with all of the roster, we would give a shit about the characters, making their stories that much more important. "
"Asking out a girl at an inappropriate place/time can absolutely be creepy. Asking out a girl cold when she's buying groceries isn't the same thing as asking out a girl who is a mutual friend at party when you guys are hitting things off. 

All of this ultimately boils down to reading social cues and being in the right environment, which I understand is super hard to many people. "
So the reason why you think you have the privilege of not caring is that you are wealthy? I'm just trying to get some context and actually understand your case. You seem like you think you have justifications but just aren't sharing them.
"I'm making a 2D platformer/shooter right now with Unity, and I know exactly what you mean by how it doesn't feel right, but I'll go over that in a bit.

Ok so the first part is just plain walking around, the tutorials I found were just applying a force to the player character to move them around, this leads to a few problems where if you release the movement keys you can slide around or never stay still if you're in the air, a similar approach was used for jumping: apply a vertical force to the character to launch them in the air, it works pretty well for most cases, but it almost always doesn't *feel* particularly good.

My approach was to manually override the velocity of the player character whenever they move, and if they're not giving any movement commands I set it to 0 to make sure they have absolute control over where they want to go. This also forced me to disable player movement when I want to play a specific event (like being kicked back if you try to kick a boss enemy, etc).

As for jumping, that one is a bit more nuanced for me as well, suffice to say there are aerial melee attacks and some delay/control over when you jump. So the thing I did is use a coroutine to add a delay between the time the jump button is pressed and the character actually jumps, in that time I can check how long the jump button was pressed so I can change how far the jump goes based on that.

Also, jumping/landing I had to use raycasts to sync up the animations properly, the normal Unity 2D physics can sometimes lag behind or just plain ignore collisions that the viewer can clearly see."
"No. This is theft. This is the difference between getting fired and getting fired and sued plus jail time.  Do not take anything from the computer. Do not open it up. Computers have switches on them that can tell if the case has been opened. Good IT departments have IPMI management and alerts when chassis intrusion events occur.

Of all the bad ideas in this thread, stealing confidential information (the hard drive) is the absolute worst."
"Technically, I'm the Cresselia mod, so I *have* to get perfect. I can't settle for anything less. :p

Cresselia isn't that slow. Speed is equally important. For example, a common Modest Heatran spread is 196 HP, 252 SpA, 60 Spe. That hits 105 speed, which speed ties with neutral nature uninvested Cresselia. If you suddenly have an imperfect speed IV, you will be outsped all the time unless you invest in EVs. Those EVs could have been put into defenses."
"&gt;I thought this was a default preset on the app

Yea I'm pretty sure 5mi/km is the default but it can be changed to as little as every mile/km or more if desired.

A HRM will definitely help, I had a watch type one a few years ago that I used when I did P90X, but I've misplaced it. It definitely keeps you in check so you don't burn out early.

I have definitely noticed a big change and I was only a half pack smoker. When I smoked I'd get winded after not much activity, so glad I quit.

"No, this kind of mass surveillance is not valid, or justified in any way, and is a huge threat to peoples security, not a boon.  If we were on a space station or ship it could be argued that we should have cameras to monitor the crew, and it could be argued that all the people on the planet are the crew of Spaceship Earth.  However, I didn't sign up for that, many people are still unaware of the full extent of it as you've shown, and we have not had a discussion about it in public.  It was just done without our knowledge, and once the information was leaked to us, they've charged the person responsible for giving us that knowledge with treason."
I have a pebble smartwatch. It has music controls you can set. I use it with pocketcasts all the time. See if there are any smartwatch you might like... I think the original pebble can be found for something like $50?
"&gt; He hosted CP in the sense that Reddit hosted CP before Jailbait was taken down. 

Jailbait was comparatively tame (though, obviously, disgusting and reddit should have shut it down far sooner). What 8chan hosted was pictures of prepubescent girls, bikini-clad, in sexually provocative poses. If it's not breaking the law, it sure is skirting it in the most disgusting way possible.

&gt; He didn't upload the shit, or make any specific effort to put anything up, he just doesn't try to moderate every single board on the site.

Sure. But also, you need to take responsibility for what does get posted.

&gt;  When things are reported to him that violate US laws, he removes them. Otherwise, he just isn't aware of them at all.

What about things that *are* reported, but he deems *don't* break laws? Besides, he admitted that he knew about these boards. He was totally complicit.

&gt;  A lack of awareness doesn't warrant a death sentence.

It's not a literal death sentence to cut off a revenue stream that depends on facilitating pedophiles. Further, welfare and other jobs are always options for him - or even just asking for money on Patreon, and deciding to shut that content down. It's not like he never had the option to act and stop the CP. Opposing his hosting of CP - and doing something about it - does not constitute a death sentence."

"Because people can't stand to see other people that aren't as lazy and complacent as they are, and it makes them unhappy.

"Thanks. I was able to test the other traits for myself.

The damage buff of Physical Strength does not affect the Nanopulse Attacks, but at least they get the bonus knockback chance.

Sadly Nanopulse also does not benefit from Soldier (+Energy damage)."
"It all depends. If I just wanted a quick sale cuz I needed cash, I'd throw away the case, and try to sell the rest for $120 plus shipping. If I had the convenience of waiting, and the gear was pristine, I'd test it all very thoroughly, and try for $220."
"[Here's a video of him in a semi-empty commons, he also directly mentions the election loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U98-WvhWrDE)

I like it when it's empty, the jeering and hand wringing almost NEVER happens and debates are way more civil since its mostly people with genuine interest in politics. The above video features Rees-Mogg, Miliband, Mark Durkan of the SDLP, Peter Grant (SNP, very relevant given the EVEL subject).

Rees-Mogg and Miliband were ON POINT there. 

EVEL is very very difficult to talk about, Rees Mogg raises that it probably should happen and is hardly being rushed because of the rise of the nats, despite that Miliband brings forth some great evidence pointing towards the current attempt being done on the back of a napkin in terms of the effort put into it.

A phrase you'll notice is ""Yeah of course I'll give way"", this rarely happens in a more populated HoC because of some of the petulent children that are present."

"This is a MUCH bigger issue than whether to say the word ""date"", or how long to wait before asking women out.

"Are you including the trade restrictions among the taxes?  That was the greater issue.  The colonies existed to feed raw materials into England, and purchase finished goods from England.  Which means colonial produce was undervalued, and finished goods were overvalued.  Trade monopolies suck, yo.  "
"I once had a great mentor who asked me, ""what's more important...the 'plan' or the 'execution'?""

I used to think that having a solid plan was good enough, but I have grown to learn that execution is far far more important then the plan. Let me give you an example.  Some countries can thrive having a low minimum wage as market forces pushed salaries up past minimum wage. Yet at the same time, other countries are fine yet they have very high minimum wages (Australia comes to mind, $17 an hour). 

The point I am trying to make is that different sets of policies can work if applied correctly. Paul and Sanders may be polar opposites when it comes to economics, but I think it is possible for either to be a successful president. You may have your entrenched ideology, but because the world is so goddamn varied, a successful policy in Country A may not work in Country B--it's hard for people to understand this sometimes. You can't apply a one-size-fits-all approach to something as complicated as politics and economics and expect success. "
"Thanks for the kind words. I know, at least the guy is real dumb for doing this in front of the whole class and for trying to play it cool on the no-dating students side. I canceled on him, BTW.

Thanks again"
"I do get a fair amount of pushback, but I'm not really there to be a counsellor, so I just try to organise it as best I can. I will, though, point out how hard it is to access what you need when there's too much stuff in the way. It's an ongoing process."
"This reminds me of something my sister told me. She was at a red light and decided to look through the CDs in her car, she put in a new cd just as the light turned green so she was a bit slower at hitting the gas than she would normally be, as she started to pull into the intersection a truck blew through the red light just narrowly missing her. Had she not thought to change the cd she would have started a few moments earlier and been tboned by a truck going around 50mph"
"&gt;I also provided an additional example of textiles in which they do very well.

Couldn't find anything online talking about this.  

&gt;With respect to manufacturing coming back to the US, it will not happen in our lifetimes in any significant degree in my opinion. Due to our minimum wage, the salary discrepancy between the US ($10+/hour) vs China ($3/hour) is too large so I don't think manufacturing will ever come back.

I bet otherwise.  More and more manufacturing is being done by robots.  And the US has the bigger labor force required to run a plant with robots in it more so than China does.  So while the wages may be higher in the US, a lower amount of labor would be needed for the plant itself in the US than in China."
"The radeonsi driver is great for Valve games.  What resolution are you playing at?  My 290X can almost do 4K CS:GO/TF2 at 60fps, but stutters when changing areas.

"Hell no. NC 6 and 8 months, with my active and passive child abuser, respectively.  I talked to them all throughout my twenties, and then got flashbacks starting last year.  Once I got the flashbacks, it was so game over for those fuckers.  I'm so angry at myself for wasting a decade of my adult life on the people who either actively tried to destroy me or idly stood by like a useless bystander.  I just keep thinking that it all could have been so much better, and I could have been so much better. 

Too bad my flair from RBN does not appear on this subreddit too. "
"You're fine, don't sweat it. 

That said, this board really pushes the 'texting for logistics only'. But I think some people take it a bit too literally. If its a girl you just met and only had a short convo with, it's kind of weird to just blaze ahead and text, 'hey it's that complete stranger you met, pick you up at 9'.  Not sure if you're omitting it, but if you've never texted her I'd at least open up with an introduction and greeting, joke, or how's it going before you start making plans.  Just a quick building rapport, as at this point you're basically strangers.   You shouldn't have to defend your words in the second conversation you've had.  Quick back and forth, get an LOL out of her, then make plans.

The 'texting for logistics only' refers to not allowing her to use you as a personal entertainment while she's bored at work.  It's about your time being valuable, and you valuing personal interaction over cell phone BS."

"Realistically, we can't waste years before we start thinking about 2020- effective campaigns are continuous rather than just prior to an election. But we still have assembly and local elections next year- and we'd be in a much better position in 2020 if we've got some council and assembly seats."
"This guys does have a point though. During s4, tabzz was the secondary carry for Alliance and he did it very well. He was better than rekkles during summer(rekkles admitted to this) and played well at Worlds. Tabzz is by no means a bad player, and he have a lot more experience than Freeze. I would not say that nobody is saying that freeze is worse than tabzz. I would say that freeze is better right now. But tabzz on form, is one hell of a scary tabzz."
"one senator per state is not sufficient representation. A single senator might get sick and would have no one else to confer with on state issues. On the other hand, too large of a senate leaves senators less able to act on individual initiative and makes the legislative process more cumbersome, making it difficult for the senate to provide effective checks on the house and other branches of government. 2 per state was the compromise between these competing pressures."
"I've been friends with an ex for seven years or so, six of which I've been in another relationship. It's a blast. We knew we were better off as friends, and I guess it's working out for us. I'm casually friends with some other exes, too. "

"I'm comparing unstable portal to far sight and burgle to arcane intellet here.

Far sight and unstable draw one card because they reduce the cost by 3. I'm saying that because UP is a reduced version of far sight because what it draws is random instead of from your deck. Then why isn't Burgle a reduced version of Arcane Intellect?

Right now it seems like Burgle is just worse in every way."

"This is sort of my cookie cutter advice for people who smoke (regularly) but start having/suddenly have some bad highs.  

Next time, before you smoke, make sure that you've got some good food in the tank and that you're hydrated on that good good (aka, H20).  

For some reason, I don't know *why* this is, but my close friend has been a regular casual smoker over the years.  BUT, he started feeling pretty bad when he was getting high.  He did some brainstorming and narrowed it down to him moving and being on a new schedule.  The times that he was smoking were typically after work, when he hadn't eaten/been fully hydrated in hours (since lunch).  And for whatever reason, when he was getting high, it would make him feel light headed/dizzy/nauseous/etc. and then fade away and he'd get back to feeling fine.

Just eat/drink before next time and see "
"There are a number of private or semi-private courses where you can get a club membership with access to the pool, tennis, restaurant etc. Many of them have activities for kids as well. It is not generally cheap, but the price can vary a ton based on your area so it might be worth it to check around and see what the costs are. There is a private course near me that is actually pretty reasonable. Trying to talk my budget into it."
"The difference generally I think is that you progress toward secondary objectives by going toward the primary objective as you collect mats from player corpses. in Ashran from what I've seen/read you have to go out and farm npc mobs first to get the items that will help with secondary objectives.

Although you can obtain fragments from killing other players it's deducted from that player's fragments where in AV it's just constant growth you don't lose secondary objective items because you died they just appear."

"1-maybe in xbox your in nox rework and for hi rez any new god or any god that just got rekited is automatically banned in leagues for a while

2-thats kinda weird not the bug but why are you banning medusa in 1vs1 she got no ult there

3-well your stun with chronos is tricky as it doesnt apply on slow immunie targets so  gods like cabrakan with his 1 for example will take the full damage but he wont get stunned any god that got cc immunie wont get stun whenever he used beads an cc immunie ult or hopefully used sprint 2 or above since it gives you a slow immunity for 6s

good lucks"
"Success is a tricky question because everyone has their own trajectory. Some people come out the gates and find success within a couple months, for some people it may take a couple years. So you never really know where someone is on their journey. I think most of the success from Icon comes from a culture where artists are encouraged to be honest with their creative process. Something we heavily preach at Icon is that it's about the process and not the product. By zeroing in on their creative process, naturally the product becomes more potent."
"Personally, I think this is all highly unlikely and that Konami really has just lost touch with reality and abandoned their mission statement and their fanbase.

But if something like this did happen, here's how I think it would go down: 

Konami execs: fuck everyone
Konami fans: fuck you
Konami execs: who cares?
Konami fans: we do. Say goodbye to our money. Have a smear campaign while you're at it.
Konami execs: well shit.
Kojima: I have a cool idea.
Konami execs: let's steal it, say it was the plan all along, and switch that hate to love! Tadaaaa
Konami fans: WE ALWAYS LOVED YOU TAKE OUR MONEY. "
"I can think of a downside off the top of my head..time zones. If you host it every 4 years in Greece, the prime time events will be on during European night hours. That leaves out half the world time zones pretty much. North and South America would be at work or it would be mid afternoon when prime time events take place. Asian countries would be sleeping at that time. The Olympics gets attention today because its a global events. Keeping it in Greece would likely turn the Olympics into a local European event rather than a global one as the Summer games would get less cache/attention if you can't watch events live. While winning a gold medal medal and representing your country are important, I can see how it would over a long term time frame reduce other countries commitments to spend $$ on Olympic programs."

1k spend on gas. 5000 points transferred. Get $70.

You'd need to spend $9500 on bonus categories every year to break even doing this, which isn't even possible, considering the 5% spend is capped at 1500 every 3 months."

"Jeb is cursed by his last name, tainted by war crimes, torture and incompetence, while ""Clinton"" makes people think of Bill Clinton's 8 years of peace, prosperity, budget surpluses, and plentiful jobs."
"A lot of these are misunderstandings by your DM, but some are also misunderstandings by yourself.

For example, yes the DM has ignored your character's background feature. That is something he is wrong about.

And you can still theoretically get lost in a forest you are in even if you are familiar with it, just like if you are familiar with a city you can still wind up at a street you've never been at before. However, such a circumstance would typically confer you advantage on the roll. since your experience would obviously allow you to overcome the challenge more easily than normal.

Further, your companion is specifically able to act as a guard animal and help keep watch and so rolls perception with its skill proficiency; just because it's good doesn't matter.

Hell, it's fully possible for a variant human rogue or bard at 3rd level to have a passive perception of at least 17 even when built with the standard array. Rolling the dice, you can easily get a passive perception of 19 at level 1! That effectively makes the sleeping rogue able to detect ninjas that you couldn't see even if you stared directly at them with a flashlight. And the DM has to account for just such a character being present.

*That said*, a beast companion can move for free during your turns but you have to use your action to tell it to attack. Especially since you lack the ""Extra attack"" ability until you reach 5th level."
"A couple of things here. You state you're not a weirdo yet some of your behavior is very, very weird. If nothing else you need to cut back on your drinking since you can't seem to control yourself.

He seems like he has tons of issues. Though not what you want to hear right now, you've dodged a bullet from what you've described. 

Be honest with yourself: This is nothing more than an infatuation related to someone you've spent very little time with in the big picture. You're overreacting. (I know what your feeling is real, I'm not saying you're wrong for feeling, just that once you're past this I think you'll see you have something else going on that leads you to feel so strongly over something so seemingly minor.)

As /u/jaycatt7 suggested keep active. Just do things. Go on with life. Don't try to ignore how you're feeling or not think about him, that'll backfire. Just acknowledge it and keep going on with life. Up your exercise for a week or two. Go out with friends. Go to an animal shelter and play with puppies. Go play sports with buddies. "

"Day 1 of TGT I was having a blast playing Dragon Warrior. I had the initiative, I could play a minion per turn, I could constantly pressure the opponent and make *them* answer *me*. I would wreck any game that went long term with Justicar for overwhelming armour totals, dragons as late game bombs and Rend went from eating Loathebs and Emperors to devouring Ysera's.

I thought I had it all figured out.

I've plummeted back to rank 10. 

I read here that Dragon Warrior should be able to deal with face hunter. But my deck with double FWA, double Alexstrasza's Champion and even double Bash just can't compete. My health total is so low by turn 5 or 6 that I've lost all the fun in my dragons.

Is there a dragon deck that can keep up with the agro and spam decks? Should I go back to the Taskmaster/Armoursmith/Acolyte core that I was so happy to leave behind?

Dragon Warrior is amazing against the slower TGT cards. I don't think it can compete with the old aggressive decks though :(

I agree. The nurses in the hospital bullied us into using formula. We saw the hospitals LC and she would try to force my son to take my breast. Of course he wouldn't. I have learned since then that that is an incredibly ineffective way to get a newborn to latch and may cause further issues. But I was hand pumping colostrum and giving it to him in syringes. The nurses came in the day after he was born and told me that he needed to eat. They brought in this huge breast pump and were making me pump. Nothing would come out because I didn't have milk and my body just wasn't receptive to the pump. So we ended up with formula. The LC i have been seeing since we left the hospital is awesome. She is so patient and knowledgeable. I really wish I could have seen her while in the hospital.
"Here you go:

1. Yes, once.  Curb was for a sidewalk w/ easement.  It was double the height of 'normal' curbs.

2. I observed the height of the curb before parking, so yes - I expected to (and did) have a problem.

3. Loaded, but it would not have mattered.  These were **tall** curbs (literally double-height or higher).

4. Opened slightly.  There was no possible way to park legally and still fully open the door.

"Well, they have the ez-bars which range from 20 to 60lbs I think, but they jump by 10 lbs which is annoying since the stronglifts program has you increase the weight by 5lbs each time you do it. I used the 20 today and I guess I'll do the 30 next week. Didn't have any balance issues with the ez bar today but it's pretty short! I'm still kind of discovering how all of this works. 

My experience with stronglifts has been great! Sometimes I wish I had more than 3 workouts on my list because I enjoy it so much. My main goal with getting fit is to lose weight. I'm counting my calories and staying under maintenance. I think that, combined with the fact that I've only been doing this a little over a month equals no visible muscle mass so far. However, I am stronger! The first day I did squats, I did it with a 15lb bar on a smith machine and was sore for 3 days. Now I'm doing squats regularly with no problems. Deadlift has improved a lot too. My biggest hurdles have been the arm strength exercises."

"I think of it as a temporary  thing. And it does ease a lot of my anxiety and anger at the world. It's nice to just turn away from it all sometimes and not get involved. It was the week marriage equality happened and there were a lot of posts about that and the Confederate flag but somehow the icing on the cake was a post about ptsd that made me realize how worked up I was getting. I don't really think I'm going to change other minds (am I really swayed by people's pro life rants? Of course not) it just feels nice to let it go for a while. But, I like seeing my freinds posts and am glad Facebook is used for political purposes, because that way I know I am not alone, I was just getting really worked up about things and so I blocked a lot of people (yes, I get it, you really don't understand why  ""straight pride"" isn't a thing) and stopped posting a lot. Now I just post silly memes and stuff like that. I'm sure I'll get caught up in another political debacle someday on social media but it's really  nice taking the break. I hated feeling attacked for my personal views and maybe that wasn't  people's intention but sometimes I didn't feel safe posting things anymore. 

Oh- I like the idea of your banner too :) "
"Oh I see. Well there are a lot of men who do something kind for a woman and then use it as an opportunity to guilt her into having sex; so this is probably why women are using the term 'entitled', that it's an expectation for basic decency. 

But, yes I disagree that 'society' thinks men deserve sex. But I would say there is a cultural narrative that promotes the idea men are likely to be rewarded with sex. Some more naive men (usually very young) believe this and then are bitter with women for not 'following the script'.

Certainly in many non-western cultures the men really do believe they are entitled to sex. Evidenced by either their lack of rape laws, or the inconsistency and failure to punish rapists."
"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines).

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"I think the vast majority of TCU fans want to drop SMU, but it won't happen for a while as we have them scheduled through at least 2019. Good thing we play Arkansas in 2016-2017 and Ohio St in 2018-2019 to make up for SMU."
"Ok, OP. 

I'm in the same boat. 

I started dating my SO a year and a half ago. In January I started a lifestyle change. Basically the same as you. 

I've lost 58lbs so far. 

We had an ok sex life (once a week or every two weeks maybe) but I wanted more. He wasn't up to it. 

But when I started losing weight he got 12 kinds of handsy and we started having sex more often. 

At first I felt horrible. I felt duped. Didn't he love me and find me attractive before?

YES. YES HE DID. 

ROMANTIC attraction and SEXUAL attraction don't always coincide. 

Your so was likely attracted to you romantically and emotionally more than sexually. And that's ok. 

But now that you've lost weight his sexual attraction has risen. 

But that doesn't mean he loved you less before. 

It just means he loves your body more now. "
"You can mirror (screencast) wirelessly with Chromecast, although that's a workaround for the main function of the Chromecast.

I recommend [watching the product unveiling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btY6FKYiZz8&amp;t=41m) or [visiting the product's website](http://www.google.com/chrome/devices/chromecast/learn.html) to get a visual demo of how it all works.

With the Google Cast protocol, you simply tell the Chromecast where to find the video, and it takes over all the work of downloading, streaming, and displaying on your TV so that your casting device (phone, TV, PC) can be free to do whatever. You don't have to keep the screen on, nor even keep the device powered."
"Perfect. Looks like I'll be modding again later but I have a few free hours tonight so yeah, I'm game. :) So I guess me, Storyteller and Niner are taking a little detour later to shoot the first victim in the head so we can log Randall in our newly aquired phone book. :) And for that matter, I'll use it for Camp McCarren's assassinating fiend quests too. I just picked up the sniper rifle so I should be able to one shot the first bounty for Randall tonight.

I appreciate you listing the requirements for the mods I'll be getting later too. This will prove handy as I can find your posts pretty fast in my inbox here.

Hey, speaking of bugs and stuff, I've heard there's a REALLY nasty glitch when dismissing Storyteller (apparently ED-Na goes hostile and kills everything on sight? Or she perpetually follows you or something?). I've heard 3 of his 5 stories and want to dismiss him once he tells me the last one. I'm thinking of picking up Cass after that (never used her. I've only ever really used Boone and Veronica). Is there a safe way to let Storyteller go?

Regarding the AI, what you described makes perfect sense. Except I don't believe I ever opened the Archives tab so I'll be sure to check there first."
"When you take the payout as well it resets the bonus % too. Which causes Drama between hardcore players who want to rat for  extended periods of time, and the dude who just ratted for 2 hours and wants to go to bed with his isk. "
"What I posted on another comment

We treated Emily in the same way as we treat anyone else who did the same thing. The conversation went something like this:
Weath: Emily has done this and we should give her this specific RWT offence Me: Would we do that to any other player? Weath: Yes Me: Do that then."
"There's an amino acid that builds up called adenosine, and when it binds to adenosine receptors in our brain, we get tired.  This is the mechanism that makes caffeine keep you awake.  Caffeine has a similar ""shape"" to adenosine so it can sit in the adenosine receptors preventing adenosine from binding and making you tired."
"If your story is bad that's not a problem as long as it isn't trying to break the sub or mess with canon. If you're a bad writer its not a Ban Worthy offense. If its just bad people can ignore it it its rule breaking and contradicting that's where I step in. "
"I used to think that way as well, but then I met one of these cats. OMG! They are so friendly and fluffy and funny and playful and curious, etc. After getting to know one I kinda understand why people sometimes pay big bucks for them (btw: I still get my cats from the HS). "

"That company no longer exists. The current agricultural company kept the old name, but share none (or sparingly few) of the employees of the old company. They divested essentially all of their chemical divisions, and the ag divisions went through a complicated reformation and merger process.

Pharmacia was purchased by Pfizer in 2002, which is the date most people would say current-day Monsanto formed."
"I think we'll see a little less hardware upgrades than we do with the phones and that the focus will be on software to drive purchases of the watches and accessories.

I think the hardware upgrades we do see will be about reducing form factor, increasing battery life, and reducing manufacturing costs vs. new hardware functions.

So, I don't really see a point in waiting if you want one now."
"[This](https://redd.it/3io6cb) is pretty cool if anyone wants Hitman Absolution and to donate to a charity.

I'm trying real hard to get back into ultra but it's not really my thing :( Too time consuming. I'll still be around though. On the bright side I'm making progress on a fun pvp map I'm making :D"
"&gt; Yes on election day, but their money goes towards spreading the word about a candidate and/or defaming another, which can sway hundreds or thousands of voters 

So those people are completely mindless, just little puppets that do whatever they're told?

Maybe the problem is that you don't like democracy. "
"Not necessarily? I've had male friends who tell me about that stuff, just like I've shared with them. Two girls that are friends will talk about sex with each other, two guys that are friends will, why couldn't you talk about it with a friend of the opposite sex? "
"I used to work 6 pm to 6 am as a packer. You need to think about it in segments. If you look at the clock and think ""I still have 8 hours"", it will make for a long night. If you look at the clock and think ""Only 1 hour to break"" it goes much faster. 

You will likely be physically sore for a few weeks, but your body will adjust. Just take lots of baths, do lots of stretching, and keep the ibuprofen handy."
"As someone who's trying to start up a guild on a high pop realm, please spare me and turn off ginvites... I deal with enough assholes joining the guild just to either spam the guild chat (New members get no bank access until 3 days have passed) or just generally make a big stink. Nobody likes putting up with that."
"Yea, that'll work just fine.  
Getting the water down to 50c in a reasonable time might be a little tricky, but manageable.  Maybe just dump in some cold to get it close and let the machine sort it out from there.  
Otherwise I don't see any problems."
"I fully agree with all of these points, and didn't mean to imply that they _shouldn't_ be a thing for anyone under 40. Just pointing out that, culturally, they're more likely to be _expected_ of you if your office is mainly staffed by people who entered the workforce when they were an absolute requirement. "
"I'm more likely to concede with 20 life vs my opponents 1, an empty board, and them with a 2 turn clock if I know I've got next to nothing to stop it than I am in a situation like that, but people think someone should scoop to their infinite life, which is always dumb if you can still hold on and not lose.

I'd probably say that at my firm the earliest is your second anniversary with the firm (so if you were hired at the start in 2015 you should start thinking about it in 2017 or later). If people aren't being promoted at all (as a cohort) then that is a little strange. Seniors bill at a higher rate and most firms have a problem with too few seniors rather than too many. Are they having a hard time in other areas? It's worth checking with a coach or a mentor to see what's up.
"Why thank you! Both my kids (8 and 12) loved the movie Robots, and Rodney Copperbottom plays the main character. With his lil red and blond butt, we thought it fit perfect :)  Was that or Duracell, I think we made the right choice ;) "
"I just came upon your post and want to thank you so very much for this insightful and well-written list.  I'm a little north of 50 and lived with bipolar II for about 10 years before finally being diagnosed in my late 20's.  Nearly a quarter of a decade later I am still trying to come to terms with what is me and what is the condition.  If I can't understand it, it's no wonder that the people closest to me can't either.  I think this list, with a few personalized footnotes may be just the vehicle to deliver the understanding that I wish they had.
Thanks sincerely."
"People change, but it's slow and inconsistent. Generally you can expect people to be the same week to week, but not so much year to year. Assuming someone hasn't changed in five years would be extremely foolhardy. 

Of course, when people say ""people never change,"" they often actually mean ""you cannot change people."" This is largely true. Although you can sometimes influence the way someone changes, it's extremely difficult to predict or control the direction of this change to any significant degree."
"You can, it might be overpriced though, I'm not sure. There are some random gear vendors around that sell gear and weapons that are decent, it might be better than what you have. Check in some of the quest hubs around your level."
"I like leshrac. Skip your stun and make sure you have level two edict when you go for runes. Edict melts her charges. It's a similar match up like viper,  in that they can both kill each other about as easily, so it comes down to current laning advantage. 

For strategy, stand at diagnals to where she will psiblade and harass her heavily with right click. Most TAs bring little regen and rely on level one refraction to secure them farm in the first wave. Take it out asap and whittle her hp down. Don't use your mana until you get two in a spell out you're being dove. I mean you can use lightning a couple times,  just remember the damage sucks at level one and the cost only goes up by 10 or something. Then,  like I said,  confront her at rune with edict. Get an ally to take the opposite rune so she can't get bottle charges. Forcing her out of lane from here should be easy. Just remember how many pulses her shield ate and try to get edict on her to eat them up fast when she starts roaming."
"I could be wrong, but to me the guy is selling a dream. If you can't afford solar power but want to feel like you make a difference, send me 50 bucks and I'll send you pictures of the third world kid that you and 10,000 others a(re) feeding for pennies a day."
"The only products that should be ordered via pH are actives. Routine should go:

- 1st Cleanser: Holika Holika Soda Pore B.B Deep Cleansing Oil
- 2nd Cleanser:  The FACE Shop Neo Classic Homme Black Allinone Cleanser (I'd personally use this one instead of the Innisfree one since it's close to skin's normal pH levels)
- pH Adjusting Toner: Etude House WONDER PORE Freshner
- AHA: COSRX AHA 7 WHITEHEAD POWER LIQUID (wait 20 mn)
- Spot Treatment: COSRX Natural BHA Skin Returning A-SOL (could go in other places of your routine though)
- First Treatment Essence: COSRX Galactomyces 95 White Power Essence
- Hydrating Toner:  COSRX Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner
- Essences/Serums/Ampoules: Go from thinnest to thickest in texture
- Moisturizer: HADA LABO TOKYO Replenishing Hydrator
- Occlusive: MIZON Snail Recovery Gel Cream

As for daytime: Cleanser -&gt; Toner -&gt; Essence -&gt; Moisturizer -&gt; Sunscreen (the amount of makeup you apply will not give you sufficient coverage. You need 1/8-1/4 of a teaspoon depending on how large the surface area of your face is) -&gt; Makeup
And you can totally include an occlusive in your daytime routine to seal in any moisture. It would go after your moisturizer and before sunscreen."
"I respond with sarcasm to my wife, because she's asked me that question so many times I've stopped trying to tell her how nuts she is.

That probably wouldn't work so well for someone you don't know as well.

I'd respond, no, absolutely not, I'd have no interest in sex with you if you looked gross naked."
"That fixed it for me when I was having issues with it. I was putting my hips half-over their hips which means they were my base and a sweep was imminent. Groups next to me would have to take caution every time I tried the knee slice pass because I'd end up on them.

I also tended to leave my 'non slicing' leg back behind me, which allowed them to trap it and make the roll easier. Leaving the leg behind will also force you to break your posture way too early in the passing process.

Once I started stepping out to the side *FIRST* and *THEN* letting my knee drop to the ground as a result of that step (not knee *then* then), I stopped getting rolled and my pass finish percentage went up. I could maintain good posture and apply pressure as needed until I finished the pass.

And then you learn how to get better at working through quarter-guard. :-P"
"It's hard to make friends unless your living on a freshman hall 1st semester...I don't understand, you had friends and a girlfriend but didn't like the school? I mean unless the school you transferred to is more respected academically, this doesn't make sense....You seemed to have it good, so you wanted to leave? Idk what to tell you man, all the college friends I made were people from my hall freshman year and people I met through them. I mean most people I know have complaints about their school, hell I get frustrated with my school all the time. But its not about the school itself, its about the people around me. No matter how much I get frustrated with my school and their policies/culture, I would never transfer no matter how butthurt I get due to my friends (unless its for academics or a financial reason). Sounds to me like you jumped the gun and made a mistake.

Let this be a lesson, never make a huge decision like that before thinking about all the pros and cons. Sounds to me like you just decided to transfer out of nowhere thinking everything would work out. Nooope that's not how life works."
"I'm a regular at a bar close to where I work. It's awesome. Customer orders a drink but has to bolt, or a drink gets sent back? In my experience that means a free drink for me or another regular patron! Hooray! Not to mention the guaranteed company, always having folks around who are glad to see you."
Can we just agree that some people like ABC and some like XYZ and that everyone should be free to play how they want. If you are in a group that likes to full clear and you don't then leave. If I'm in a group that keeps closing immediately then I should leave and find another group. Just because one might theoretically be better doesn't mean that everyone should be forced to do it.
Because of dressing. When its hot you can take clothes off but you might get sunburnt; put clothes on and you overheat. Either way heat drains you of all energy. I like looking at sunny days but winter seems to be more practical.

"&gt;Linkins is becoming a better alternative to BKB against Lina picks and the like and it offers amazing stats to help her trash health pool and has an amazing active. Underrated item.

Your reasoning seems to make sense but I can't help thinking of that god-awful weaver linken's rush build. The price of the item should be lowered for it to be worth the money imo."
"FUD and gloom n doom. 

XT is more than just block size, it is a whole paradigm shifting bait-n-switch focusing on supporting SPV special interests, not block size. The block size cap can be changed really quickly and is not an urgent issue. A forward thinking long term solution is what is needed and there is no super urgent us-or-them solution needed. Feigning one through FUD should be your first clue that something is wrong with his position."
"tbh I play solo queue and as a premade and I rarely get salt against me from the enemy team if they're a premade, but if you're a premade and you lose about 50% of the time you'll get a ""noob premade"" or ""lol shit premade can't even win"""
"Hmm nothing official to rant about... OH! I got one.

Dear Washington: Please get your shit together. All this smoke coming up to Alberta is burning my eyeballs and making me cough. Also we have short summers as it is and I miss the sunlight. 

Dear Canada: Please help Washington and other places on fire (think B.C might be going up too) get their shit together. Air goes everywhere. This is an issue for all of us.

Yeah I know it's completely unreasonable for a request it's just all I've got. Good luck to everyone fighting the fires out there or surviving the smoke. Sending you guys all the positive thoughts!"
"I'm 32, and I pretty regularly get mistaken for a teenager. That in itself is not _nearly_ as annoying as all of the people who tell me I'll be thankful for it later. :P

On days when I need to look like a proper adult, I find that makeup helps a lot.  Clothing definitely changes how a person looks, too (color and cut is a language all its own), so you might consider taking a really good look at your frame and figuring out which current styles make you look more mature.

Make sure you're standing straight. Confidence is frequently mistaken for maturity.

That said, what else do you think they're saying when they say ""We're at different life stages?""  Are you still in school, what kind of job are you working, et cetera? Are you certain it's all based on appearance?
"
"Next week, what everyone was waiting for finally begins. Shit will go down when our favorite lolis Magical Girls fight against the most hated/loved sonofa of the Fate series...and I'm not talking about Kotomine XP"
"I don't have all the answers, but the problem is that the people who have the expertise to write said bill, cannot because we can't pass anything through congress on this subject. 

Even if we somehow created a miracle solution that could instantly see the future, and thus prevent anyone that will for fact, 100% accuracy, prevent anyone that will commit murder or suicide in the future from buying a gun, It still would not pass our congress. Which is why I ask a purely hypothetical question, and get berated."
"Pandering is part of campaigning, Sanders panders as well. As for lying, well, I don't know if I can agree with you on this... why should it be expected I can trust Sanders but not trust Clinton?

My point being, as there's no way to foresee their future actions, should either of them become the President, I have no way to guarantee to myself that either one of them are telling the truth. 

So instead, being a life long democrat, I choose to trust them both as telling the truth."
"In a way, I love FemShep the way she is (yes, even the panties and the terminator walk.. she need her quirks). 

I wish they had made an additional scene at Citadel with VS or included VS in Arrival instead of making it a Solo mission. They don't really need to resolve their relationship but it could give Ashley a reason why she became Lt Cmdr later in the game. But at Kaidan is one of the characters who are well-written from the start (even without the help of DLCs or narrative patch up with comic series.. ehem. Liara). I find its sad that Ashley is always the default VS who lived. Even in Arrival, we have Ashley inside the reaper visions and there's no Kaidan version in it.

Carth is like a renegade version of Kaidan in ME1 but he's funny like his character Scorch. If you watch Murder in the First, Sbarge acted as Detective Molk who is more or less like a version of Kaidan. "
"Thanks for the great giveaway, too bad I haven't won this one. I was really looking forward to this for trying out Linux and learning it a bit already for when I'm transferring. Well thanks anyways and have a great day :("
"as of late june yea. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3171597/Lorde-posts-intimate-flashback-snap-boyfriend-James-Lowe-happy-couple-celebrate-26th-birthday.html

looks like she's engaged to him too"
"Actually, since the term ""prepubescent"" refers to before the _onset_ of puberty and not the completion and the ""normal"" range according to most sources for the onset of puberty in girls is 10-14 (with 11 being the average according to some sources), over 50% of 13 year olds will not be ""prepubescent""."
"I know you can keep your domain, etc. with google. We took a LONG time with migration, doing split-delivery during the transition period. Given that it was over 700 accounts, with over 95% of the users off-site, I felt it went very smoothly.

Edit: wording"

"&gt; Whatever happened to this idea of innocence until conclusive guilt?

It is a court issue, not an issue for the rest of us. And I never said he was guilty, I said he was indicted. Which he was.

&gt;Most couldn't be happier to see him go. If there is any grain of truth to any of this whatsoever, it's a hardly a reflection of the wider movement. 

Never said it was, it is a reflection on the Pauls though. You can claim that Ron had no idea it was happening. Whether true or not it becomes part of a pattern of his using his ignorance of what his direct hires to as a defense. This controversy existed before Benton got his job running the Rand Paul SuperPAC. I would hope that someone asked Benton about the case before hiring him. "
"Storing is more efficient. You have to go out and find crates, and it takes up more space in your inventory. Storing, on the other hand doesn't take up multiple spaces in your inventory. And storing is unlimited. Space in crates is limited."
"I like this idea, not for chains but I can see a use for the slot. In BR for example they are talking about collars to keep players from teaming in single player. That could translate into single player where you might be able to find a collar and a remote... ohh yeah, do what I say or I blow your head off from 300m away =P No more putting your own ass on the line for that scrap metal. Make your lackey do it for you. Just a thought."
"I know a good deal about what they do. I don't like it. I'm kinda' tired of people telling me I shouldn't be concerned, that it's no big deal, it's just telemetry.

If I can't know what it is, and if I can't turn it off... or even if I can, if the controls are purposefully obfuscated, and if those collection mechanisms are on by default I have a pretty big problem with that, and that IS the scenario.

i don't believe that's the question most people are considering here. i think the question at hand is if she were to qualify and compete right now in ADCC, could she win. and the answer is a resounding no."

I was being specific about his keyboard, not the switches it uses - rather, the fact that he's a network security wizard that uses a gimmicky 'gaming' keyboard.

"I don't want to post for him, but I'm sure he'll be fine if I answer your questions: It was not a pre-sale wallet. He did not store his key loosely (gmail/dropbox). It was taken out in three transactions - first 5, then 2500, then 40. He did have an open port for remote json-rpc connections - this is my leading suspicion. He left the port open because when any of us were experiencing geth difficulty during olympic we would send him our miner hashes."
"Is the observatory in the trailer using WIP lighting? This was mentioned earlier, but observatories almost always have no lights because the light interferes with the telescope. What they do have is [badass star lasers](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/07/24/why-observatories-shoot-lasers-at-the-universe/), so maybe the devs can put that in if they want observatories to have lights at night"
"Which is why things like quality control exist, which is a negligible cost compared to having capital tied up in stock production. 

&gt; Nintendo's still at a risk by simply putting their branding on the figurine and can end up costing them in the if the Amiibo doesn't do well.

You are talking out of both sides of your mouth now. First you were arguing that Shovel Knight happened because he was so incredibly popular, now you're saying an amiibo of an extremely popular game character may not do well. History would indicate that amiibo based on popular video game characters will sell TREMENDOUSLY well. Shantae and Shovel Knight are both popular video game characters, and the financial risk is low for Nintendo (as is any sort of other risk with adequate QC). Again, there are reasons to be skeptical, but so far none of them have anything to do with what you're saying."
"My 13 year old brother is obsessed with video games, plays them probably 18/24 hours of the day. Here's the catch: he jumps up and down and shakes the floor while he plays them, screams profanities LITERALLY NON-STOP, throws things, etc. His room sounds like a child's insane asylum. Whenever I have a friend over that isn't used to it, they sit outside his door and record a video/snapchat and within 30 seconds they're crying laughing and have captured what I endure on a daily basis."
"Just posted this in another thread and in in thinking how could you can rationalise the situation: A scenario could be to setup a loss at Canning. Community outrage and negativity towards the coalition by the border force incident makes Dutton the patsy, but Tony is not directly responsible. Off the back of this, another leadership challenge. Preferably Tony voluntary steps down as so not to give Labor any ammunition. Maybe offered a knighthood as a bribe. Morrison then tales over as leader and PM...Murdoch has already met with him on his recent visit to Australia."
"That what I mean none of them saw it happen, yet they watch and slowly walk over as the other team goes after her. Seems like the girl who did the kicking is probably a dirty player in general. Usually team sports you have  each others backs even if you don't know what's going on. So them just watching and not at least running over to try and break it up makes me wonder about if this sort of thing happens alot. "

"To me, it's heavily implied. Joe buys a motorcycle and joins a riding enthusiasts club. Joe's neighbours, Fred and Mike see how much fun Joe is having zooming around town on his new bike with his new friends - Fred and Mike ask Joe about his motorcycle and both go out and buy one each plus a membership in the club. Joe sees this, immediately jumps on his biker blog to complain about how the streets are filling up with bikers who'll be selling their bikes within a month.

Sounds like what OP is implying with beekeeping. And in my own inferior opinion it's very rude. Who cares who wants to buy a bike, learn guitar, build models, etc. That's my rant. We'll just have to agree to disagree. "
"&gt;When the officers entered the woods, **the suspect attacked them and was able to disarm Officer Burnette.** He then shot both officers.

again, this goes back to me saying that cops should be more capable at beating ass. how is this (more than likely) untrained dude going to over power *two* cops?

and in the Ferrell case, there was three, not two. i feel like it should only take one cop to sufficiently fuck someone up, let alone three. with three cops, this should have resulted in an embarrassingly one sided beat down, not the kid being killed.

"If you select any country but China you will just get stuff from a sweatshop in Indonesia or Bangladesh, I don't really see the difference. Also the product quality is not determined by which country it is in, companies pick which factories they are made in, what they are made of how durable they are etc. not the factory."
"Yes, very long and torturous road. I can't tell you how many time I approached the equipment manufacturers, road construction companies, and capital investment firms only to be told ""great idea but sorry, we are not going to help you."" But the world was a different place then and there wasn't as much focus on limited government budgets or concern over  wasted fuel economy and the release of greenhouse gases. But I haven't lost confidence in this technology or let the Nay-Sayers stop me from pursuing the goal of changing a very dirty, costly and disruptive practice being perpetuated by the road construction industry."
"When I flirt with people I don't touch them without consent, and if someone touches me and thinks they're flirting they're going to have a broken finger.

TELLING someone to touch you is not the same as someone randomly touching you just because they're talking to you.

"This is a parody account, right? Like I'm not *actually* supposed to humor the notion that an objectively accurate description of ""twine darling"" is an ethical transgression worth giving even an atom's worth of a shit about, am I?"
"Well, I think the basic idea here is that 'if it sounds good it is good'.  Experiment with whatever sounds you like.  

I know from my personal experience a Boss DS-1 into the drive channel of a Marshall MG is not a great tone.  Way too much gain, no definition, very buzz saw like sound.  But in some genres of music that may be ideal.  

I'd also be cautious with the drive knob on both.  The DS-1 has a ton of gain.  I found the usable range to be between 8:00 and 10:00 on the dial.  

You could also try using the DS-1 as a boost.  It is very common for players to use a gain pedal with the gain set completely off, but the level up really high to boost an already driven amp a little further.  This typically works better with a tube amp and a nice low gain OD pedal, but its worth trying."
If he gave admin powers to anyone they could have done it too. This is why I just can't trust admins on private servers. If your admin did it he's just going to lie to you and say it must have been a bug.
"My personal experience is that it really depresses the roll.  You don't seem to ever achieve the blissful euphoric feeling that mdma is loved for.  If you're waiting 6+ weeks between rolls, I wouldn't waste the precious opportunity by mixing it with an amphetamine.  The only thing I'd mix it with is LSD.  Also, it made me really fucking irritated on the come down."
"He just needs to put it in his mind. The more it is in there, the more likely it is to ignite something. Don't feel bad looking at boobs and butts and all that good stuff.

"Eh. I mean, paladins cant use it when the board is full. And there are plenty of conditions for most of the other classes where they cant use their hero power, too. Well, they ""can"", but they might as well not be able to. 

Priest with no heal target (turn two anyone?). Warlock with full hand/no cards left/less than three health remaining. Rogue with a better weapon out.

Hunter, mage, druid and warrior can always use their hero power to some advantage, though."
"Somewhat unintuitively I think the Railgun is actually a very viable support weapon.  It doesn't really handle crowds well, but when a big threat other than an IFV shows up, you can quickly stunlock it while your teammates scramble to safety and get out the big guns.

Paired with an Avenger it really handles anything short of an IFV.

I like the Avenger better than the Rumbler as a support because it's so quick to cripple a whole swarm of incoming.

Notably the Avenger is worthless vs. Illuminate, so for them I'd swap in a Rumbler/Obliterator/Commando for some mid-range 'splosions."

"&gt; Meanwhile 90%+, even higher realistically, of domestic abuse shelters are exclusively for women

It must be those dastardly feminists."

"Oh man, the central coast is fucking awesome. I've lived in Lompoc for 8 years now (grew up and lived 23 years in Los Angeles) and the Central Coast is the tits. Everyone smokes weed, people are chill and laid back, and there's an even mix of liberals and conservatives and everyone is pretty tolerant of each other. It's one of the few politically neutral areas in California. I fucking love the weather, you can't beat the coastal weather, man. "
"The flipside to this is that when everything is more expensive, it's also easier to make money. At this point in the game it's basically just glorified inflation. Things may cost more but their relative worth is the same."
"In a different way I think Atwood does well in the Handmaid's tale. Her character is not a prudish woman but is forced into seeming to be because of the insanely religious dystopia she finds herself in.

One scene in particular she has sex with a man she only knows from afar (because she's not allowed to interact with men). She finds him attractive from the get go and has a very satisfying, if vague, scene with him. Even though little is said about him, I found myself attracted to this mysterious and distant silent man.

"Nothing required.  Women are encouraged to cover their heads but many don't.  No sort of finger wagging or anything that I've ever seen.  Modesty should the general rule (no shorts or tank tops) but you generally see anywhere from slacks and polo shirts on men to suits and ties.  Women usually in dresses but have seen the usual mix of clothing.  "
"Is 163k too much? Maybe, maybe not. No service records sucks, because that would be handy.  If the car looks good to you (and try to bring a car-savvy friend for a 2nd set of eyes) then definitely get a carfax done, and then take it to a shop for a PPI (pre-purchase inspection). It will cost you $100-150 on average and they will put it on a lift and take a look at all the important bits. If the mechanic says it's cool - go for it. If there are some serious problems, then you should run away. 

TL;DR - 163 may or may not be too much, have a qualified mechanic to put it on a lift."

This recipe doesn't sound like that, so what kind of beef am I looking for?

And would any white beans do? I would usually go for butter beans. Should they be dried? 

Sorry for the many questions!"
"Well first of all, you list political parties which represent the minority of their nation's people as if their mere existence somehow implies that they are driven by the lower class (possible) and that they are affiliated and involved in the football scene (questionable).

Apart from that, you're argument seems to be ""the European working class is racist, football is a sport of the working class, therefore football is racist."" 

I'm not going to say that you're wrong about xenophobia in Europe, because honestly I don't really know enough to make an informed decision, but your logic just seems like flimsy conjecture."
Really? I figured they would at least release all those weapons before the August update. So were any weapons leaked that were added during the August update? I would think someone would have hacked into the game to see by now.
"You are correct. A parody needs to build on and relate to the original work to get protection, not just be funny. Penny Arcade had a problem with this years ago when American Greetings told them to take down a [strawberry shortcake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Tart_as_a_double_entendre.png) comic that parodied American Mcgee's Alice. They tried to get the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund to back them up but the CBLDF wouldn't touch it because the parody was of Alice, not Strawberry Shortcake, so they didn't really have a leg to stand on."
"Since it's reddit and all.. someone's got to point out that this would be 1099 income.. since you're a poo subcontractor and all.

"No problem! I usually encourage people to move on to 3 if they have sour experiences with the first two, because it's pretty hard *not* to like 3, and it's more enticing to return to the older games once you've been properly absorbed into the universe. Good luck!"

"&gt;  I have turned Off/Low most of the stuff in graphic card settings

In H1Z1 there aren't a lot ingame settings so far (it's Early Acces Alpha), quality settings were on ""High"" by default and if i wanted to change it, it bugged/didn't save. So i changed some settings in the H1Z1 folder -&gt; ""UserOptions.ini"", like 

- ShadowQuality=0
- FloraQuality=0

and added some lines for better mouse aiming (i looked it up on google/yt) and since i did that, when i enter H1Z1 the quality setting says ""Custom"". 

Also i dont run it with max resolution (which would be 1600x900), i think its 1366x768.

My NVIDIA graphic card settings, u can specify them with installed driver for each game u have, are all on the lowest option possible, so for more performance instead of quality.

"3 cards. 

A yellow to the orange player for unsporting behavior and intentionally lying down on the ground like that would be a dangerous play and result in a free kick for the white team.

A red card for the intentional kick to the head. 

A red card for the orange player who then retaliated (under the circumstances this one may just be a yellow).

Depending on how the cards play out, play may restart with a free kick for the orange team or a dropped ball. "
"M83 [Losing Control] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lc9VXu-9DM) from the Oblivion OST. 

This song will give you anxiety depending on if you're aware it's on or not. Like if you have a mix on and you're mowing the lawn, all of a sudden, you find yourself stressed out as shit mowing the lawn towards the end. Builds so well.

I would highly recommend this OST in general. So good."
"Ok you took sandpaper to it, sand paper is used between coats not on the final coat, the final coat you just buff/polish. 

All that is, is finish dust it's nearly impossible to get off, you need another finish coat and after don't sand, just get some polish and #0000 wire ball thingies (I forget the exact name) and give it a once over (tight circles) depending on how much of a shine you want do it more but remember buffing too hard takes the finish OFF. 

Good luck."
"It does seem odd that the police don't use their quirks.

Sounds like pretty much every other profession does. It's been mentioned that there are so many jobs available for people with electric quirks that it's odd to see one take to crime. Ochako mentioned that her quirk would help with construction work a lot.

This chapter is the first time they've started talking about quirks making somebody a human weapon."
"Very generally, I'd agree.  However, there's a caveat to that. Since the advent of the concept of personal property humanity has lived with the disparity of wealth being the *norm*.  Such a disparity has existed since antiquity, so to think it's only just become a problem in the past century is folly.  Also, in all that time, whole civilizations flourished, so to suggest the disparity of wealth is inherently detrimental to society requires a bit more evidence.

"Feedback: **THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.**

An all-in-one photo thread is the best route. No one needs to wade through 2 pages of photo albums and/or requests. 

The Cheers/Jeers threads are always important, but I think that rolling each into their own megathread is the best call. There's so damn much bitching over petty shit or perceived slights/oppression that a single thread where everyone can participate is warranted. Arguments otherwise are the same people that claim oppression and censorship and just want an audience to validate their ire.

"If bitcoin were actually a decentralized system that sounds like a pretty good idea.  Not as good as a dynamically adjusting algorithm that changes based on network usage, but a good start.

"I would imagine their are protective spells blocking portkeys from being created or being used to enter into the school. 
Looking at the Goblet of Fire portkey in the tournament, I doubt Crouch created the portkey but altered its destination. To me it fits with the fact that Harry was able to grab it again and take him back to its original destination. So the portkey was probably created by the ministry or Dumbledore.
Then theirs the portkey in OOTP, made by Dumbledore who controls the magic guarding the school. "
"&gt; if you're passed out of otherwise unable to give consent you can't consent

Absolutely. I know, but that wasn't the case in this case. I never said that consent isn't needed or anything, what gave you that idea?

&gt; but rape is the absence of consent for sex

Yeah but at the same time, the moment you ask consent explicitly, a lot of women will be turned off that you're not being dominant. 

&gt;she could still choose to not consent when the situation actually presents itself.

Yes she can, that's my point. And she can do it after it happens too. They have all the power of the law on their side. She can change her mind at any point or have regrets at any point and then the prosecutors would have easily made the same exact argument.

&gt;They're not going to come out an issue a statement telling the world their daughter is a stupid bitch for even going

Agreed. But still the way they act like everyone is at fault (even people who are not part of this case) is unnecessary.

"what, the fancy new animatronics and stuff? The phone guy spends a portion of the first phone call in FNAF 2 gushing about them, outright saying that the company spent a ""small fortune"" on them.

As for the building, the fact that they have no power budget means they have significantly more money than they do in FNAF 1 (Where you had to conserve power). There is definitely a safe room in the building (that's where the old spring suits are located). Since they were sealed off due to budget restrictions at some point before FNAF 2, it can only be assumed that they have more money now since they wouldn't have bothered to build one otherwise.

Also, the company isn't owned by different people. What makes you think someone is ""taking over the company""?"

"If the comment was meant to elicit some sort of girlish reaction, the blonde must have been sorely disappointed as the Tyvian replied with a seductive pout of the lips that slowly pulled into a small grin.

""That's true, everyone has their skills and talents. Like you, *krasivyy*, you're quiet...seem to prefer the company of yourself over others, but it could just be that you're not sure how to handle others, despite wanting to interact with them. And you don't seem quick to act, rather taking a bit to rouse yourself into action, but its all done with a purpose, like its some elaborate dance that you're trying to plan out 12 measures ahead of time, hoping your partner doesn't step on your toe and ruin it all.""

"*Aretha Franklin ~ Unforgettable: A Tribute to Dinah Washington*

Before she broke out as a true soul great with *I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You*, Franklin recorded this album as a tribute to Dina Washington who had recently passed on. This album was actually the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful of her Columbia years. 

Aretha Franklin had a personal connection to Dinah Washington through her father, so this was a very personal album for her—and she wanted to do Dinah right. 

If you're only familiar with Aretha's work from the late 60s onwards, this recording will come as a shock. At this time, her vocals were more influenced by jazz—which is why her voice takes on a more silky timbre. Nevertheless, the Aretha that would later be known as the ""Queen of Soul"" makes her presence known especially on tracks like ""Nobody Knows The Way I Feel This Morning"" where she just lets loose. 

Gary Chester's work behind the drum kit is snappy, and Ernie Hayes' organ is downright groovy. Aretha Franklin also impresses as a pianist, and shows there's more to here than that legendary voice. 

As far as divas is concerned, this is a passing of the baton.

"Make the changes. In the end it is not your business and you have zero stake in ownership. There is a time where you simply keep your educated recommendations small and straight to the point while doing what they request. At this point you work and keep the ball in their court as much as you can. The office manager likely has WAY more on her plate than the directors do and likewise will take longer to respond. When you get info or changes or something, do them and hand them back quickly, or as your normal work flow allows. Follow up after a few days. As for the logo/brand redesign, do you give deadlines or is it an open ended project? Projects with no deadlines often never communicate urgency to any degree. So therefore they won't sense the urgency that you have. Not sure under what sort of contract or how they are paying you but if it's by the hour or if your contract specifies a certain number of rounds of revisions, that usually helps them be more efficient in communication also since now your goal has a deadline."

There is a difference between being a good person and being a well-intentioned one. Your dad is doing a bad thing because he thinks it's a good thing this does not make him a good person it makes him an ignorant one although it could be claimed that voting ignorantly is morally damning in its own right. The long and short of it is that your dad votes for people who devalue the human rights of marginalized groups and while he may not do so because he shares that opinion and he may not even realize that's the case it does not absolve him of responsibility for that support.
"&gt;  the Liberals are not that great either, but at the very least they made promises of increasing infrastructure spending. It's something that is badly needed, and frankly the only interesting thing said so far in this whole election campaign by any party.

The irony is that everyone used to whine at Trudeau for being an idealist without substance lol.

While I agree with you that it's kinda boring right now, there's a lot of things explaining this:

* It's a really long electoral campaign, and there's still a month and half to go. I think that candidates are still keeping their juices for a better moment.

* Compared to parties in other countries, Canadian parties don't have that much of disparity between them. So I guess you'll see less heathed debates.

But otherwise I completely agree with you."
"I don't doubt it, I used to make beer bread and it's more or less the same idea.

"&gt; ...can someone give me an example of endgame content that isn't a gear treadmill?

WoW raids involve gradually better gear, but it's really not the point. The bosses are very challenging and usually have unique mechanics, which is what keeps people interesting. Often *really* weird mechanics, like on Iskar where you throw an eye around and whoever is holding it can see through the boss' illusions to deal with certain abilities (and the world actually looks very different while you're holding it), or Oregorger where the fight stops after a while and turns into an odd game of Pacman. It's enough to keep you busy.

The downside of such raiding content is that you **have to** be in a guild to enjoy it. You can do the lower difficulties with random people, but it's only on the higher difficulties (heroic/mythic) that you really get to experience the various mechanics properly."

You're correct. That is Rugby. Although being tackled doesn't mean you can't touch the ball down. If you can touch the ball down while being tackled it counts as a try. Defensive side of it- you can prevent a try by preventing the offensive playing from touching the ball down.
"I actually purchased one because to me it seemed as though I was getting the benefits of a HTC One in a nice plastic shell. In fact when my friends see it, I normally compare it as the 5c to HTC's 5S (so to speak).

The cameras are decent with pretty good post processing software. It performs well, it's waterproof, and it's also a nice looking phone. I'm actually very happy with it.

The thing that sucks the most? There is barely any rom support for it. I think there's something like 4 roms out for it now, and it's been just about a year.

"&gt; From my understanding, it's not difficult for serious criminals to get guns.

It's true that they can get guns packed in with shipments of drugs. However, that's definitely more difficult than simply buying a gun over the counter or robbing a gun that doesn't have to be stored very securely because there are no laws making you do that.

I target shoot and the laws in Ireland are very, very restrictive to prevent guns falling into the wrong hands. Even a single shot air rifle is classified as a firearm here and requires a safe bolted to a wall and an approved alarm system. Purchasing ammunition requires you to prove that you have a license for a firearm in that caliber.

"I'm a cook, and you're pretty darn close:

The massive bird flu outbreak began way earlier this year, but the areas that were hit hardest were not the ones that produced the in-shell eggs that we typically see in grocery store, but rather those that went to things like [prescrambled eggs](http://www.meatdiscounts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Musclefood_Liquid_Scrambled_Eggs.jpg) and such. 

The demand for those prepared egg products is still there (fast food, big bakeries, etc), but those particular flocks have yet to recover, so the big food suppliers are taping into the in-shell supply, which is driving up prices in places that aren't directly dealing with the outbreak.

Chicken prices are down because many countries have banned importing US chicken due to the bird flu. "

"Just had something very similar (albeit not as ""realistic"" or important):

Met a friend online in a game, added each other on Steam. Had a great time together for many days. Then suddenly I'm ignored completely for 2 days whilst they play other games then it's back to normal. I thought they were busy or something. Then again, fun few days, and suddenly ignore mode again on the other games. For about a week now this time.

Checking their friends list turns out there's two other people who whenever come online, I'm instantly shoved to the side and it's off with them. Right away they get playing with them instead. (They're not in a relationship or anything either, just another few friends.) So basically as you put it:

&gt;I'm just placeholding until someone better comes by, so what do my feelings count for anyway, right?

In the sense that ""oh those two aren't online, I guess she'll do until they are back"". Magical wonderful people they sure are.

Wouldn't have bothered me if they just told me, but no, it's off to ignoring everything I say with maybe 1 or 2 basic messages back, clearly just wanting me to shoo away until I'm needed. Like, thinking I won't realize or something, or that I won't care. Didn't even just introduce me to them so we could maybe play as a group, then with me if they are busy, nah. Even if they get on better together, I can accept that - but why try and hide it from me then treat me rude if I talk to you? Why not just say ""sorry, I'm with some other people at the moment, I'll talk to you later"" instead of an unrelating ""lol"" and ignore?

Friend removed. Those two aren't online right now (one just went on holiday for 2 weeks apparently) and my ""friend"" has nobody to play games with now.

"I get the whole perspective of ""a lot of what we hear has bias,"" but you may want to read into [North Korea's human right's record](http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/north-korea), or maybe take a look at [the way they report news.](http://www.kcna.co.jp/index-e.htm)

Their human rights record includes such gems as ""brutal forced labor camps, known as kwan-li-so, operated by North Korea’s National Security Agency.""  In these camps, ""The government practices collective punishment, sending to forced labor camps not only the offender but also their parents, spouse, children, and even grandchildren. These camps are notorious for horrific living conditions and abuse, including induced starvation, little or no medical care, lack of proper housing and clothes, continuous mistreatment and torture by guards, and executions. Forced labor at the kwan-li-so often involves difficult physical labor such as mining, logging, and agricultural work, all done with rudimentary tools in often dangerous and harsh conditions. Death rates in these camps are reportedly extremely high.""  These are not my words, they're the words of Human Rights Watch.

North Korea's news reports are also known for making numerous threats of war.

I'm all for skepticism, but sources seem to disagree strongly with you, [even in the specific case of this tractor pulling a rocket.](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/07/27/North-Korea-celebrates-Victory-Day-with-show-of-military-might/61321374935486/)"
"If you mean legitimate SLP/SLIC-activated factory images on millions upon millions of consumer machines, then of course it does. There would be no possible or feasible way Microsoft could block that, because honestly, the vast majority of Windows users out there aren't wiping their machines all day long like us here. They pulled it out the box, and used it with that factory image ever since day 1. It would make no sense at all to do such a thing. But at any rate, yes, I've personally upgraded several test machines and family members' machines starting from Dell Win7 Home Premium/Pro preinstallations or reinstallations from OEM media that check against the SLIC tables in the BIOS, and they act all the same in these Win10 upgrade situations.



If you're referring to some type of piracy method or crack that emulates SLIC so that an SLP key can activate(kinda like KMS activators you'd find on torrent sites), then I can't comment on that. No idea. But I strongly advise against it either way."
"&gt; I am somewhat confused by the rest of your comment, though. The entire point of the article is that while you may press two different keys on your keyboard, (say, ""Escape"" and ""C-["") exactly the same character code is sent by the terminal to the application. So it is impossible for vim to distinguish between those keystrokes. Was that not clear because you weren't sure whether the article applied to terminal emulators? (It does) Was it unclear for some other reason? I am eager to make sure the article is as clear and concise an explanation as possible, so I appreciate your feedback.

Sorry, let me rephrase that.

Since my tests are carried out in a terminal emulator called xfce4-terminal (which emulates xterm-256color), I'm not quite sure if it's something that modern terminal emulators added as part of functionality, or it's something that old terminals did, and modern terminal emulators copied this kind of behavior.

I do understand that key correspondences are there because it appears that key correspondences are processed by the terminal emulator before it even reached Vim. However, I have a slight suspicion that Vim somehow creates the key correspondences as well... The reason is this:

&gt; EDIT: I managed to modify Vim's source code to unconditionally treat Ctrl-M as Ctrl-N without affecting Return. While doing so I also realized that indeed there is no way to do that without source code change, as the distinction between what has actually been pressed - Enter or Ctrl-M, appears to vanish much too early in key-press processing. It happens in platform-dependent UI modules, and the portable code part in key-press handling already has no idea if Ctrl-M or Return was actually pressed that resulted in key code 13.

&gt; My modifications were in GUI modules for FreeBSD (GTK) and Windows, as those are the platforms I use gvim on most often.

This comes from 

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3935970/vim-how-to-map-ctrl-m-without-affecting-return-keypress-as-well

from FvD's original post. Granted, it appears that the code that maps these key correspondences are in the GUI code. However, I find it odd if that's actually the case, since it appears to me that if there is special need for Vim GUI modules to remap keys, they shouldn't be in the source code, but should be written as vimscript and sourced at launch to provide some flexibility, and to avoid key mapping problems (which we were discussing in the first place). Hence, I'm interested to see if there are more experimental results to see who's processing which key..."
"First part of my comment is a possible explanation.

Second part has nothing to do with Muslims. As some commentator has mentioned that so far, the bulk of the refugees were from Balkans. But it would be disingenuous to claim that given the current scenario that number of refugees from MENA region won't outnumber those from Balkan. And the stats are to encourage discussion about percentage of immigrant population of a different culture and extent of assimilation. "

Of course there is bias, every caster may have some degree of bias but saying a phrase like ""She is very biased"", ""She doesn't know what she's talking about."", ""Her voice is annoying.""

"You have a terrible taste in Princesses. Luna and Twilight? Seriously? You picked the pony with the edgiest of edgy backgrounds - one whose backstory was conjured from the mind of a self-harming 14-year-old (I mean literally, she manipulated her own dreams to 'punish' herself - how fucking emo is that?) - as a character to draw inspiration from?

Not to mention Twilight 'I-really-want-to-fuck-my-brother' Sparkle, who - without the help of a Deus Ex Machina or two - would have failed at the first hurdle.

She didn't give two fucks about the others until they came to bail her ass out after stupidly trying to overthrow an over-powered alicorn who had to be banished for 1000 years just so the in-show fucking GOD didn't have to deal with her shit.

Your waifus are shiiiiit.

I would have commented on your fedora, but it seems you traded it in for an extension to your autism. I mean badges on a cap? Seriously? Not to mention that said cap depicts one of the dumbest overused memes of the 21st century.

If I saw you go through the portal to Equestria, I'd smash it so hard fucking Tirek would feel it all the way from Tartarus.

"I prefer to watch them the way they were released. They do them out of order because they group them in roughly 4 episode story arcs that span over periods of time. they do this because its hard to have well developed stories in just 22 minutes of episode time.
"
"I'm no expert but they do serve many strategic purposes:

1) familiarization and routine: The more you use the equipment, the better you get at it, faster, more accurate, less mistakes etc. Also routines such as seen here""Salvo fire"" where Artillery A fires for some time, then Tanks B fire, then Copter C firs, then A ,B,C and repeat need to be synchronized and tested to make sure everyone is doing it right.

2) Fixing problem before they arrive: finding out what method did not work, who messed up and why, and training to deal with the random things during war. Also helps to ""weed out all non-hackers who are not attack gear in my beloved core"".

3) equipment maintenance: Some of this equipment must be used and moved around or else it goes bad, degrades.

4) morale and support: It is fun to fly jet, shoot explosives and etc. Teaching the troops the power they have raises confidence and morale. Having troops sit around do nothing makes them feel useless.

5) Propaganda and morale: Taxpayers want to see that their country is protected, they want to feel safe, and those thinking about joining want to see what they are in for.

6) Deterrent (Dick Waving): Yes, its also a warning, in the same way the US flew a B-2 Stealth Bomber non-stop from the US to SK, dropped a few dummy bombs and flew back non-stop. It means "" This is just a sample, dont fuck with me""

7) Exploration of battlefield: By training in different areas with different equipment, different weather patterns, seasons, landscapes, they can come up with the best way to approach each individual scenario. This knowledge is passed down trough the military, perfecting the war capabilities and so on. Essentially, each battlefield is different and practicing in Training grounds A,B and C is not the same as Battefield D, and so on. "
"You cannot rule the possibility that we are running in a matrix-like simulation. Do you have any reason to believe it though? Does it seem more likely than other explanations?

I don't fundamentally detest any theory. I detest reasoning that fits a purpose. You want to believe what you believe, you never asked yourself the question. And not just your theories are unlikely and quite confused to be fair, in your worldview they would culminate in a God that inspired some bronze age man to write a book full of contradictions that is concerned with arbitrary and pointless rules. 

I'll give you a simple explanation. There's no magic in consciousness. It's neurones being arranged in such a complex way that complex functions can be reproduced, so complex that they enable us to think about ourselves and about what other people are thinking. There are possibly other chemical structures that enable similar processes in other parts of the universe or possibly in other Universes. This doesn't fit the Bible narrative but doesn't it seem to you like a better way to explain things?"

"""Damn and blast!"" Rincewind said, peering up from the cold, hard dirt -- at least, he would think of it as dirt -- as the Creatures of the Dungeon Dimensions variously lurched and wobbled closer towards him. 

Now not only was he going to face an endless nightmare of unending suffering without hope for the sweet mercies of death, but he was going to do so naked, which was to say, without his hat. A wizard, or in his case a Wizzard, could only truly be said to be in the nudd if he had lost his hat of office, and since the Luggage had kept a firm grip on his hat in a vain attempt to pull him back through the recently opened portal to the Dungeon Dimensions, he was now not only here but also thoroughly embarrassed, not at his disrobed state but at the lack of that one badge of office which would have allowed him at least a modicum of dignity as he gibbered with fear and agony for all time.

Picking up his staff, Rincewind judged he had about 100 revolutions of a demon's hand before the Creatures reached him. He could hold his breath longer than that, if only because unlike most wizards he preferred being able to run long distances at great speed to the pleasures of a pipe. It wasn't much time, but should grant him just enough life to make a new hat. It was important, the hat. Death himself came for wizards, at the end. But bare-arsed Rincewind with no hat proclaiming his Wizzardry might not warrant the honor. So he needed a hat.

Rincewind had barely received a pass on completing his hat. It had flopped slightly at the top, and he'd been marked down for sp., whatever that was, but he'd done it. It had been judged not worth the trouble of trying to teach him again how to do it properly, so he had been allowed to get on with wearing it on strict orders that he not do anything to embarrass the University, which he had promptly broken at 11:42A-M (Ankh-Morporkian) by turning several mugs of beer into a large pile of sick.

Still, he'd made a hat once, and he would do it again before he died if he had anything to say about. Which he did. Once he remembered the words to the spell.

This was the problem with Rincewind. He had done perfectly well with remembering spells right up until that time he'd answered a dare to read the Octavo, the Creator's own grimoire. Since then, he'd never been able to remember the words to any spells, including the one which had leapt off the page and into his mind. But now, with a certain incessant, imperative need oozing and shuffling towards him, the words began to form. He could remember. And yes, it had never been the best of hats, but it was HIS hat, and marked him a Wizzard, and he would not go to his eternal unrest without it. He didn't even mind the floppy bit.

""Ashonai."" he began. ""Ebiris. Urshoring. Kvanti."" That, he thought, would make the brim, and the pointy bit. ""Pythan."" The stars. ""N'gurad."" The moon. ""Feringomalee."" Not all graduates of Unseen University felt the need to write ""Wizzard"" out on their hats, but he liked to make things plain and simple for any tavern tough who might think twice about assaulting a wizard and then, following the thought process through a second time, would emerge to find that said ""Wizzard"" was three city blocks away and rapidly increasing the distance.

""Isgendie."" He finished, and stood waiting, but nothing happened. Last time, his hat had popped neatly, or, rather, had popped disheveledly into existence, but it had most definitely popped. And quickly. Almost as soon as he had spoken the last words, as a matter of fact. Why, no sooner had he said ""Mitra Capuchone Aureole Regentia Magus Chapeau..."" 

But wait. Those weren't the words of the spell he'd just uttered. Although now, he couldn't remember the words he had spoken, but he knew they'd been...different. What had it meant, though?

Ah. Now he had an answer. 

""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!"" he screamed as a light whose brilliance he had never before dreamt of engulfed him, cascading in unending glory and searing brightness through the whole world, or what passed for one here in the Dungeon Dimensions. As though it meant to consume all, the light filled every space, every thing, until it felt soon there would be nothing but the light. 

Kneeling in awe and too overwhelmed to think, Rincewind was at first oblivious to, then puzzled by, a tapping on his shoulder. He looked up to see the one Being who, even in the light of all the stars that ever were, could still radiate a deep black.

""HELLO AGAIN, RINCEWIND,"" the robed figure said, peering at him with the eyeless gaze of eternity. ""I SHOULD BE GETTING ALONG NOW, IF I WERE YOU.""

Rincewind looked at Death, something he liked to avoid whenever possible but now found almost a relief in the wash, no, the torrent of light that caused his eyes to water even when they were shut tight. ""Aren't you here for me?"" he yelled, unsure why the blinding radiance made him feel compelled to shout to be heard, as though the light were noise. ""I tried to make the hat! I tried! You have to take me! I'm a Wizzard! Don't leave me to those things!""

Death turned back to him, scythe blade rasping along a whetstone, and the rictus of his skeletal jaw seemed even more than usual to have the slightest hint of a grin to it. 

""OH, I'M NOT HERE FOR YOU. NOT TODAY. NO, YOU HAVE MILES TO GO BEFORE YOU SLEEP.""

""I do?"" Rincewind roared. ""But how? How do I return to the Discworld? I don't even know how I came to be here!""

""STEP INTO THE LIGHT."" Death intoned.

It held enough command that Rincewind asked no more. He stepped towards the source, the bright heart of a thousand suns, and found himself falling, plummeting down a tunnel made of pure Octarine light, a beam of magical energy radiating into the Dungeon Dimensions from some unknown source. Unknown, until he fell with a sudden and spectacularly uncomfortable CRACK on the lid of the Luggage, which had been sitting mournfully by the wall he'd been pulled through, battered hat still firmly gripped in its...mouth, he supposed. He watched, as from every direction the magical field of the Discworld coalesced into a living, pulsing light that flowed in a stream towards the Dungeon Dimensions.

""I suppose we ought to run,"" he told the Luggage, ""though with that much magic to feed on I don't know that anywhere will be safe from those Creatures.""

But the Luggage made a kind of small hopping gesture towards the portal through which Rincewind had twice fallen, the one from which he'd landed in cold, gritty dirt on some other world, naked, as he realized he still was, quickly grabbing his hat. And then he saw. Saw that the magic of the Discworld was not feeding the Creatures. It was coalescing. It was a single glint, brighter than a diamond made of fire, on the point of a scythe. It was honed to such a fine edge that where it swooshed through the air the sound of cutting glass could be heard. 

Death looked up at the Creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions, and, just possibly, grinned a little bit more. 

""I CAME HERE"" HE DECLAIMED, ""TO CHEW AN EMULSION OF SUGAR AND RUBBER EXTRACTED FROM TREES, AND KICK ASS. AND THE CHEWING HAS FAILED OWING TO MY LACK OF CHEEKS AND THE EMULSION SUBSEQUENTLY FALLING INTO THIS DIRT HERE.""

A smaller robed figure emitted what would have been appraised by anyone listening nearby to be an approving squeak.

The Creatures never had time to flee. 

The End

"I do my best to respect the wishes of those who do not want to know all the details before they see a movie but I have to admit I don't really understand their reasoning.

A movie is a 2 hour experience and it just seems that some people only enjoy the few seconds of the surprises. They tend to be the same sort of people who can only watch a movie a couple of times and then they get bored with it. For me a movie only gets better with each viewing. The first time is nice but then 20th is just better because I have time to take in every little detail. For a movie like the first Avengers I have had a chance to watch it so many times that I have noticed all the background bits. The subtle little things that you just don't see the first time because you are watching the main action. Sometimes the reactions of those in the background are just so good. Movie makers sweat every little detail but it takes a lot of viewings to really see it all.

The thing is that every movie will always have things you did not know about. They will never cover every little thing that happens along the way. So no matter how much you see ahead of time there will always be plenty you did not see."
"The real problem that we are facing is that the legal costs in fighting local, state and feds is prohibitive. Every law they pass will be defeat-able, but cost countless millions to fight. The reason being that nic gum, lozenges and patches are not taxed under the 'sin tax' schedules. Ultimately THEY are looking for their piece of the pie and have no idea how best to do it, nor do they understand the margins juice companies operate on OR how much juice the average person vapes. Likely they will find that taxing the nicotine from the source is the best way to get their piece. That said, they could levy this tax from the online suppliers and collect the tax under the recent ability to tax online sales. The scary part, again, being that they have zero understanding of how our industry operates. The good thing is it should be cheap enough to appeal bad legislation and keep the issue in limbo for a while. At least at the federal level. "
"Actually, it's merely proof that the software update you claim to have solved the issue did not make the issue 'disappear'.

Coincidentally, that makes you wrong.

If you want proof that it's a hardware fault, do what I did. Take a broken OnePlus One (The more affected by the touchscreen issues, the better. Mine would be completely unresponsive if placed in my pocket for more than a few minutes), take it almost completely apart, and test it with a multi-meter. You'll find that the touchscreen digitizer is grounded to the inner (metal) midframe. (And if you don't find that, you've beaten me and proven it's a software issue for that phone! Wowza!)

You'll also find that placing polimide tape under the digitizer ribbon cable on the metal midframe corrects this, and the touchscreen issues disappear entirely.

Or you can continue to assert your unfounded opinion on everyone."

  &gt;This is probably not viable since it is a more complicated solution to this issue, but here it goes. Automatically move the size constraint in one direction (smaller), let miners vote to allow moving the constraint in the other (bigger). The idea here is to solve a few incentive problems with regard to miners voting on the blocksize, or simply allowing the network to handle it based on current sizes.

&gt;To me, the protocol itself should be the thing that determines the size of each block. It should determine the size based on the utilization average of a previous number of blocks, and aim to have that number be consistent. This is the way the mining difficulty works, but with size instead of time. The valid problem that people have raised with this, is that larger miners have an incentive to increase the blocksize, and can do so by creating cheap, garbage transactions to increase the average size. This is why, out of current solutions, I prefer BIP 101 which simply increases the blocksize on a fixed schedule, ignoring what any greedy miners may want.

&gt;But maybe I have another solution.


Constrain the blocksize to an average utilization of the previous x blocks 
By default, only allow that constraint to get smaller.
Require some percentage of the previous y blocks to be casting a vote to allow the constraint to get bigger.
Miners still don't vote on the actual size, they just allow the constraint the freedom to move in both directions


&gt;This prevents miners from voting to make the blocksize smaller, as well as not allowing increase of the blocksize without agreement from some percentage of the miners. It allows the network to scale quickly if needed without requiring another fork.

&gt;I'm sure smarter people than I will be able to find things wrong with this, and I am totally open to it being ripped apart. I have no attachment to this solution, I just thought why not share it since at the moment it seems pretty reasonable to me."

"Hello, Scotch friends! Today I'll be taking a look at three of the cask-finished entries in the Glenmorangie lineup: The Lasanta, Quinta Ruban, and the Nectar D'Or. All three are Highland whiskys bottled at 46% without any chill filtration. 
***
##Glenmorangie Lasanta##
__Nose:__ Red grapes, which was a real ""well, duh"" moment as soon as I identified it. Beyond that, I thought the nose was pretty interesting and complex. Past some vanilla and caramelized sugar, there's lime, star anise, and a rich note of raisin. This is also mixed in with a little bit of rubber and earthiness, which reminded me of fall leaves.

__Taste:__ Soft and gentle on the palate. Woody arrival. Dry on the tongue like a Cabernet. A bit of earth and tobacco. A tad lemony when rolled around the mouth. I was expecting this to be extremely sweet and cloying based on some of the other write-ups here, but I think it's rather well balanced and mellow. Thought I was drinking a 40 or 43% neat, and was rather surprised to find the 46% on the bottle. A little water turns the bitter orange tastes into chocolate orange and brings out some new flavors, including white grapes, grass, breakfast tea, and toffee.

__Finish:__ Short, though far less sour and astringent than I found Macallan 12. Dry. The oak leaves a little bitterness and earthiness. Becomes a little more astringent with time. Not the best, but certainly acceptable. Some residual sourness, but faint enough to not be an issue.

__Rebuy:__ I'd be more likely to buy this over Macallan 12 for a scotch I think gunning for the same profile, but my own taste skews away from this style and towards more traditionally sherried highlands. Probably not.

__If it were an actor:__ Stephen Baldwin. It's not bad, especially if you really are expecting to not like the performance it gives, but it's definitely in the shadow of its bigger brothers.

__3/5__
***
##Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban##

__Nose:__Chocolate cake. Plums, lemon zest. Peaches and tangerines. Honey. Guava once I let it chill out. Water brings out a little bit of a sharp wood note, like cedar and fresh-cut hay. Along with a little bit of bubble gum or cotton candy, inexplicably. 

__Taste:__ Initially hotter on the palate than the Lasanta, but richer. Honey and vanilla with dark berries. Cherry, raspberry, blackcurrant. Red licorice. Dark grapes. A touch of coffee dust. A splash of water tames the heat and ups the sweetness. Chewy now, with more maltiness. Like the Lasanta, I get a chocolate orange thing going on, this time almost more like a high Cacao % chocolate and a Grand Mariner taste to the orange rather than an OJ and milk chocolate kind of brightness I'd say the Lasanta has.

__Finish:__ Not nearly as drying on the mouth as the Lasanta and quite a bit longer. Good blast of berries and coffee on the outro. Considerably more warming even at the same ABV.

__Rebuy:__ Given enough time, absolutely. Definitely seems more harmonious than the Lasanta to me and more akin to my own personal flavor profile. Closer to the dark fruit / dark chocolate of the Dalmore 12. My 50ml taster left me wanting more, which is a good sign. Solid 4 stars and it'd be at home on my shelf. Definitely the winner above the Lasanta.  

__If this were an actor:__  Michael Douglas in Wall Street. Pretty well-regarded critically, and you know maybe it's capable of a more nuanced performance, but you went into it knowing it would be pretty good and found yourself in agreement.

__4/5__
***
##Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or##
__Nose:__ Waffles with butter and hot maple syrup. Peach cobbler. Vanilla. Cheese danishes. Sweet dates. A small hint of fennel. Subdued cinnamon and clove. A little bit of lemon and papaya. Orange rind. The GlenMo house style is there in the background, for sure.  

__Taste:__ Soft on the palate. Warmth spreads gently across the tongue with so much of what was promising about the nose. Sweet, but malty. Like bread pudding or crème brulee. Repeated sips grant a little bit of soft grassiness and some perfume. A touch of water tips this in the net for me. Still sweet, but now we've got a more buttery mouthfeel replacing the spreading warmth. Grassiness diminishes a bit and is replaced by more biscuity, bread-like flavors. Rather than the chocolate and orange of the Quinta Ruban, this one hits me with all of the gobsmacking loveliness of a fresh-baked snickerdoodle cookie. Be warned: this really is dessert in a glass.

__Finish:__ On the short side of medium, but pleasing. Honey and oak float pleasantly on the tongue and continue to give off wisps of cinnamon. Holding it in the mouth turns it just a tiny bit astringent.

__Rebuy:__  Yes, please. There's a few other highlands that are competing for the “dark fruit kind of sweet” spot, but the Nectar D'Or gracefully handles the “light and sweet” category. Dangerous in that the glass ends too soon, which means the bottle will as well.

__If this were an actor:__ Leslie Neilsen. Maybe it's not the most complex thing in the world, but boy is it fun and enjoyable.

"Comic book stories are generally very convoluted.  I think it's by way of keeping the regular readers interested in a series; putting the characters off-balance by adding a lot of side characters and story arcs.  Unfortunately, this has the effect of keeping newcomers out of comic books.

Comic book *movie* stories, by contrast are generally contained to two hours by trimming away the side characters and story arcs.  Comic book movies are thus easier to follow, generating more interest than comic books.  

They also have animated explosions and celebrity banter."
"Tbh, it's complicated. She initially said she'll help them qualify for the LCS. But she's either camera shy or afraid of the attention, like how twitch chat spams grill whenever a girl is there. One of the two. If you watch the 1st place games, they try to not use R's face cam as much as possible. But either way, she kept telling the fans that she won't appear at the spring split if they qualify. Renegades do qualify and a week later she says that the support gave her the courage to play throughout the LCS. So right now, it's a yes and I hope it stays a yes. But there's like 6 months until the spring split so she can still change her mind."

In refusing to run to catch trains, I have felt the true value of elegance and aesthetics in behavior, a sense of being in control of my time, my schedule, and my life. Missing a train is only painful if you run after it! Likewise, not matching the idea of success others expect from you is only painful if that’s what you are seeking.*

*You stand above the rat race and the pecking order, not outside of it, if you do so by choice.*

*Quitting a high-paying position, if it is your decision, will seem a better payoff than the utility of the money involved (this may seem crazy, but I’ve tried it and it works). This is the first step toward the stoic’s throwing a four-letter word at fate. You have far more control over your life if you decide on your criterion by yourself.*

*Mother Nature has given us some defense mechanisms: as in Aesop’s fable, one of these is our ability to consider that the grapes we cannot (or did not) reach are sour. But an aggressively stoic prior disdain and rejection of the grapes is even more rewarding. Be aggressive; be the one to resign, if you have the guts.*


*It is more difficult to be a loser in a game you set up yourself.*

*In Black Swan terms, this means that you are exposed to the improbable only if you let it control you. You always control what you do; so make this your end.""*"
There is a huge motive.  The reason its addicting is that it feels great when you are able to equalize after a 2-0 deficit at half and win with a 90 minute goal.  It also gives bad players more games to win that would otherwise quit after being beaten every game.  It even keeps good players playing because they feel like they have not mastered the competition if they are still losing games.
I see your point but let's assume (not including the people who got it for free) they sold a million copies at $20.00. Not including DLC. You're going to tell me that's not worth it? XBox community is pretty damn big too
"&gt;I agree not to provide restriction on what happens within my modpack, including but not limited to what other mods are present, the config settings used, and gameplay style

What if your changes cause issues and bugs with the mod which then get blamed on me?

&gt;I agree not to deliberately crash the game under any circumstances

Any? What if your world would be corrupted otherwise due to some kind of strange bug?

&gt;I agree not to give special privileges to any user, including myself, friends, other modders, donators, or community celebrities (e.g. Jadedcat)

Why specifically point out Jaded? Also, what constitutes a privilege? Do decorations? Does the knowledge of the mod's mechanics constitute a privilege - as it often is with lacking documentation?

&gt;I agree that I will never include code or deliberately ignore a bug that makes a world unplayable, including a crash loop, serious exploits, or unusably low performance

I don't see an issue with that, though some could argue that ignoring unusably low performance also counts when it's the user's fault for straining their computer too much.

&gt;I agree that I will strive to make my product as best as my capabilities allow, and will solve issues in a timely manner

I'm doing this for the love of the craft, not to please you.

&gt;I agree that I am making content for the community, not the other way around, so my wishes are secondary to the community whose members enormously outnumber me

Again, making this for the love of the craft. Playing my mods is not a right, it's *your* choice. Just don't play the mod if you don't like it.

&gt;I agree that under no circumstances will I hold the user responsible for the content in my mods

What if the content is user-generated, like skins in Armourer's Workshop or blueprints in BuildCraft?

&gt;I agree that I will not provide any restriction on how my mods are played, and will not advocate for one play style over another

By the simple act of making a mod you advocate a specific play style by making design decisions which play in favor of one play style or another. In other words, most mods have broken this one.

&gt;I agree that I will take full responsibility for damage caused by my mods, as it is after all my content

I... can't even. Are you aware that almost every open-source program in the world has a ""NO WARRANTY/LIABILITY"" clause?

&gt;I agree that all communication between me and you will remain confidential unless you choose to release it

Why? So you can mock me but I can't mock you? This is deliberately unfair.

&gt;I agree that I will be polite, courteous, and respectful of all users

Fine.

&gt;I agree that permissions I give to you are nonrevocable

What if the owner changes? What if I am forced by law to do so, by, let's say, violating another mod's copyright?

&gt;I agree that I provide a reasonable certainty that my content will not adversely affect your gameplay enjoyment

Positively and negatively? Every mod out there affects gameplay enjoyment in some way. Some, like FastCraft, cause serious enjoyment changes.

&gt;I agree that I will strive to be a productive member of the community, and that I will refrain from criticism of the users, regardless of the circumstances

What? I'm sorry, what? Keep in mind the non-revocability clause here, folks. I'm promising that I will *never criticize anyone who uses my mod ever again*.

&gt;most of the sane ones will have no issue [with this agreement]

Wait, what? Taking away the rights of free speech, allowing you to mock me in an unidirectional way, taking away the right to control my own mod's direction is *sane*? That's essentially turning modding into a police state, and a poorly implemented one at that.

And the best part,

&gt;I release this agreement under LGPL.

Using a source code license on a document shows how much you know about agreements, sadly.

Overall, 2/10, nice bait.

EDIT: BONUS!

&gt;But there are still some holdouts that require users to agree to a set of rules should they use the mod in a modpack.

Did you know that the MIT license requires you to agree to a set of rules to use the mod in a modpack? As well as the LGPL and the GPL? Read them again. Now find a mod which is in the public domain fully. (There are a few, so try really really hard to find them!)"
"I think the most important context is to slow down injury-related inflammation. For example, let's say your knee has started to get inflamed from squatting (tight IT band or something like that). Every time you squat, you inflame it more, which ends up causing it to take longer to heal. If you can control the inflammation, you can then squat more without damaging it as much. You'd still want to treat the cause of the problem in the first place, but chronic missed training that your CNS is ready for is likely worse than the attenuation you might get from some ice therapy.

If you're going to train hard in weightlifting, you're going to face pain that is not associated with hypertrophy. Ice for DOMS is probably not a good idea, since DOMS shouldn't prevent you from training. In any high-frequency or intensity program, however, you're probably going to accumulate chronic pain in one place or another that might eventually hamper your training if you don't get on top of it."
"My local BP is a mix of both, as long as I stick to the 30's age group I'm good. It's a shame too, there's a 28 year old that does in calls only that has a pretty great body, but I'm not willing to risk going to jail for a prime piece of tail. "
I'm also a big fan of the rivalry. I almost had a colts fan but me last year because of my Hernandez jersey. I just kept telling innocent til proven guilty. Now I can't wear my jersey anymore cuz he is guilty.
"I corrected the errors you pointed out. 

About where the grammar got weird: The hard part for me was writing everything in the past form because a person is telling the story. So I thought that it might be not perfect. 

But well it isn't easy to correct your writing if the story is in another language. 

But thanks for pointing out the errors and thank you too for your feedback."

"Yeah, driving the speed limit makes you a grandma.

You're enforcing the idea that you're a terrible driver. 

No wonder you hate me, I dare to infringe on your undeniable right to drive however the fuck you want consequences be damned!"
"*hugs* and cheers! I'm a bit farther out (my son is 6 months now) but I remember these feelings. All of them. The anger bursts are much fewer and farther between. I hated those first few months because I felt like a monster. I hated what my brain was telling me. I hated crying all the time. 

For me it got so much better. I went back to work at 8 weeks and that helped break up the time with the baby. I felt more capable and less helpless. I still sometimes struggle with the catastrophisizing, but I know it's my brain being a psycho bitch and it's not worth worrying about. What are we eating for dinner? That's relevant! That's going to happen! I make myself insane if I let myself dwell in the statistically unlikely harm and injury that aren't going to happen. 

So, hugs and drink up. I'm a great mom even though in the beginning my brain told me he'd be better off if he was raised by someone else. It was wrong. "
"&gt; good photography skills still required

If only this were the case, there are so many 'professional photographers' out there charging good money and producing crappy results it makes my heart hurt for the poor souls that paid them.  "
"Yeah the problem though is dealing with your customers. 

I work for a company that sells blinds, at the time I was an installer. We use products manufactured in the US and Mexico, both of which have pretty good standards most of the time. The boss wanted to capture the I'll-just-go-to-home-depot market, so he added a manufacturer from China. 

Now, in our industry anyway you almost never get paid in full up front, payment comes after the job is done. Normal lead time was 4-6 weeks, Chinese lead time was 8-12. Okay so he figured he had to float a little more cash a little longer. He didn't anticipate that literally all 5 of the orders we placed with the Chinese manufacturer would take nearly a year to complete when you consider all of the remakes that were necessary. 

Even though the manufacturer only charged us for the first set of blinds, he lost his ass on those deals and also tarnished his reputation in the marketplace. He also had to offer partial refunds to those customers in order to smooth relations with them. 

Needless to say, we don't even consider Asian manufacturing anymore. "
"I'm tired of the tobacco industry flacks using this sub as an advertising medium. As you say, it may not be working as well as I think, but at least I'm *trying* to do *something* to counteract the tobacco industry."
"""Again, if any mother is like me, it’s when I can no longer stand on my own two feet due to pre-term labor and frequenting the hospital. Let me put it in plain English.

"The problem comes from a narrow idea of freedom used by many in the libertarian camp. They see freedom only as the absence of oppression/force/bullying from the government. But you can be downtrodden by more than just the government--corporations, your neighbors, etc. "
"Ah yes it was... but did it actually provide the data is apparently captured? No... they said numbers... but they provided no photo evidence from which this data was collected.
